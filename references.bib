	abstract = {The increasing frequency and severity of droughts, driven by rising global temperatures, are impacting crop yields. Elucidating the response of agricultural ecosystems to droughts under different management practices is vital for food security that supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 for zero hunger. Our study revisited the spatio-temporal evolution of record-breaking drought event of 2012 in the continental United States by using a 3-month Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3), and analyzed the impacts of such drought based on three satellite-based ecological metrics, including structural metric (LAI) and physiological metrics (GPP, GOSIF) across the irrigated and rainfed croplands, respectively. Generally, these metrics exhibited obvious seasonal dynamics, and successfully captured the drought-induced stress on agriculture in 2012. In rainfed croplands, LAI was more sensitive to drought compared to the other two metrics. Specifically, during the 2012 drought, LAI in rainfed fields was below the multi-year average at approximately day of year (DOY) 161, while GPP and GOSIF began at about DOY 177. By contrast, LAI and GPP simultaneously captured the negative anomalies in irrigated croplands at approximately DOY 169. Compared to the irrigated cropland, the rainfed cropland showed larger cumulative decreases in LAI, GPP, and GOSIF from June to September 2012 by about 3.64, 12.92 g C m−2, and 0.55 W m−2 μm−1 sr−1, respectively. Spatially, all negative anomalies increased throughout the growing season of both rainfed and irrigated croplands in the continental United States. The percentage of negative anomalies in irrigated fields was lower than in rainfed fields during this period. In this study, we illustrated that irrigation plays an important role in mitigating meteorological droughts in agroecosystems as well as providing safeguards for human food supply.},

The procedure is illustrated with an analysis of the spatial relations among the physical properties of an alluvial soil. The results show the main influence of the scale and the shape of the basic models on the goodness of fit. The choice of the number of basic models appears of secondary importance, though it greatly influences the resulting interpretation of the coregionalization analysis.},

Until recently a suitable and simple technique for the spatial characterisation of surfaces was not readily available. Now, thanks to the development of regionalized variable theory there is a near-ideal tool, the semivariogram. The semivariogram is a function that relates semivariance to sampling lag. This function can be estimated using remotely sensed data or ground data and represented as a plot that gives a picture of the spatial dependence of each point on its neighbor. This paper provides an introduction to the semivariogram and indicates how it could be employed in remote sensing research.},

A generalized linear model consists of three components: a stochastic component that defines the probability distribution or quasi-likelihood of the response variable; a linear predictor that is a systematic component describing the linear model defined by the explanatory variables; and a link function. Parameters in generalized linear models are estimated using maximum likelihood. Diagnostic statistics and model checking methods used for linear models provide a starting point for generalized linear models.

	abstract = {The authors propose a new climatic drought index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring.},

	abstract = {Background Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) mixtures (ABG) can be effectively managed in Southeastern United States under cut and graze management systems. However, there is still a need to investigate the influence that bermudagrass cultivar has under these harvest management strategies (HMS) grown in this mixture. Methods A 2-year trial evaluated bermudagrass cultivars (“Russell” or “Tifton 85”) interseeded with alfalfa (“Bulldog 805”) under three contrasting HMS (cut only [CO], graze only [GO], or cut and graze [GC]) in Tifton, Georgia, USA. All data were analyzed for animal performance, forage, and total system performance using the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS. An economic benefit–costs analysis was performed to compare the returns to each HMS on a per-hectare and a per-head basis. Results Bermudagrass cultivar and HMS did not interact in any parameters evaluated (p {\textgreater} 0.35). Overall, HMS affected the responses more than bermudagrass cultivar. Forage and animal productivity were generally greater during the in-season grazing period compared to the deferred grazing period. Cutting management maximized total system performance (p {\textless} 0.01). Economic analysis of computer simulated feeding outcomes indicated a net return of {\textbackslash}2831 and {\textbackslash}1295 ha−1 yr−1 for CO and GC systems, respectively, compared to an actually achieved return of \$209 ha−1 yr−1 for the GO system. Conclusions Based on computer-simulated feeding results, addition of cutting management to the forage system, whether CO or in addition to grazing, provided better agronomic and economic returns compared to only grazing ABG mixtures. Future research should test the feasibility of the computer-simulated results and evaluate how ecosystem services are impacted when utilizing these HMS in other ABG mixture combinations.},

The objective of this review paper is to demonstrate how alfalfa forage breeding and systems research efforts have identified opportunities for increasing alfalfa contributions in these regions, along with potential pathways for seed industry and farming operations to increase adoption. Our review draws primarily on reports from the Southeast United States and Argentina. Significant technological advancements in plant screening and selection have identified alfalfa plant populations that are more adapted to the growing conditions experienced in these regions, which are often characterized by mild temperature, long growing seasons, and multiple other abiotic and biotic stressors. Management systems research conducted in the United States and Argentina has demonstrated the use of alfalfa for conserved forage, grazing, or dual-purpose use in monoculture or mixtures with warm-season grasses such as bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.). These trials report increased forage production, nutritive value, and ecosystem services of alfalfa–grass mixtures when compared with traditionally N-fertilized warm-season grass-based systems. Grazing-based alfalfa systems in Argentina have demonstrated methods for utilizing alfalfa as part of beef, dairy, and finishing systems. Some approaches for expanding alfalfa production in the region include targeted marketing efforts for adapted varieties and demonstrating alfalfa applications within existing farming frameworks. This includes educational programming efforts and on-farm demonstrations to promote alfalfa use as a component of the livestock diets, integration into grass-based systems, crop rotations, and wildlife use. Continued emphasis on a systems approach to alfalfa inclusion represents an opportunity for improved forage and livestock production in warm, humid regions of the world.},

Results indicate that productivity growth in the dairy sector was widespread, albeit with considerable variations by herd-size class, region, and production type. Western and Southwestern States—Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona, and California—experienced the fastest productivity growth with annual rates between 3.52 and 4.40 percent. Meanwhile, Southern States—Kentucky, Georgia, Missouri, and Tennessee—were the slowest growing with annual rates ranging between 0.89 and 1.74 percent. Furthermore, productivity across the largest herd-size class with more than 1,000 milk cows grew at an annual rate of 2.99 percent while the smallest herd-size class with fewer than 100 milk cows grew at an annual rate of 0.63 percent. Finally, organic dairy operations grew at a much slower pace of 0.66 percent compared with their conventional counterparts that grew at an annual rate of 2.51 percent},

This region also supplies the vast majority of the seed for the nation’s alfalfa plantings, and it contributes significantly to exports of alfalfa hay and seed. Western states played a crucial historical role during the development of alfalfa in the United States, as alfalfa moved from West to East in the latter half of the 19th Century. A present-day survey of western states showed a wide variety of production practices in these states, ranging from 2 to 10 cuts/year, from very dormant to very nondormant varieties grown on soils from heavy clays to beach sands. Respondents reported water and irrigation management as key limiting factors. All but one state reported that the importance of alfalfa was increasing in their state. Alfalfa is likely to remain a key crop or increase in importance in these states due to the ascendancy of the dairy industry in the West.},

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.},

It has recently been shown that those regressions may produce misleading estimates if the policy’s effect is heterogeneous between groups or over time, as is often the case. This survey reviews a fast-growing literature that documents this issue and that proposes alternative estimators robust to heterogeneous effects. We use those alternative estimators to revisit Wolfers (2006a).},

	abstract = {This paper considers identification and estimation of causal effect parameters from participating in a binary treatment in a difference in differences (DID) setup when the parallel trends assumption holds after conditioning on observed covariates. Relative to existing work in the econometrics literature, we consider the case where the value of covariates can change over time and, potentially, where participating in the treatment can affect the covariates themselves. We propose new empirical strategies in both cases. We also consider two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions that include time-varying regressors, which is the most common way that DID identification strategies are implemented under conditional parallel trends. We show that, even in the case with only two time periods, these TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) time-varying covariates being affected by the treatment, (ii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates in addition to only the change in the covariates over time, (iii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, (iv) treatment effect heterogeneity with respect to observed covariates, and (v) violations of strong functional form assumptions, both for outcomes over time and the propensity score, that are unlikely to be plausible in most DID applications. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases. We propose both doubly robust estimands and regression adjustment/imputation strategies that are robust to these issues while not being substantially more challenging to implement.},

By incorporating stochastically simulated crop-yield reductions into a partial-equilibrium model of global agricultural markets, we compare commodity supply, demand and price responses under two alternative trade pathways: a trade-liberalised world and a trade-restricted world. By implementing the same sets of yield reductions (input) on these two pathways and comparing synthesised market outcomes (output), we examine the role of trade as a mechanism for ensuring more resilient agricultural markets. Our findings indicate that trade integration could stabilise food availability and mitigate domestic and world price volatility. While trade policies can play a significant role in mitigating food-security risks in a climate-uncertain future, they must be complemented by broader policies to enhance global resilience and food security.},

	abstract = {China imports 65\% of the globally traded soybeans to meet the demand for vegetable oil and animal feed, accounting for about 85\% of the country's total consumption. Extreme weather events (EWEs) significantly disrupt the global soybean market, with impacts transmitted to China. Using Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA) and a global agricultural partial equilibrium model, this research examines the effects of EWEs on global soybean production, trade, and China's soybean-related sectors. The findings indicate that single-country EWEs have modest impacts, but simultaneous EWEs in multiple countries lead to global soybean production declines of 8.8\%–17.1\%, resulting in world price increases of 9.5\%–33.2\% and a decrease in China's imports by 1.5\%–20.7\%. Soybean oil and meal prices in China would increase by 0.8\%–16.7\%, and meat prices would rise by 0.1\%–3.9\%. Consequently, consumer spending on soybeans and meat may increase by 10.7–174.1 billion yuan. China's soybean stocks play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of EWEs. Releasing stocks can limit soybean price hikes by up to 8.3\% and meat price hikes by up to 1\%, potentially lowering consumer spending on soybeans and meat by up to 37.4 billion yuan. Several measures are proposed to mitigate the impacts of EWEs and enhance resilience, including international cooperation for stabilising production, improving domestic stock and demand management, and building production capacity.},

At the same time, China’s domestic dairy industry is in the midst of rapid modernization. According to projections in the China Ministry of Agriculture’s National Dairy Industry Development Plan for 2016-2020, three-quarters of all dairy consumed in China will continue to be produced domestically. The remaining demand will be satisfied by imports. Major dairy exporters New Zealand and Australia have free trade agreements that lower tariffs on their dairy products entering China. The European Union’s 2015 removal of quotas on dairy production increased global dairy supplies, and a larger portion of this surplus may be exported to China. The United States has a well-established trade relationship with China. The modernization of China’s dairy industry has encouraged U.S. exports of feedstuffs and other intermediate inputs. However, U.S. dairy exports to China fell in total value and market share in 2015 and 2016. The decline may be attributed to a combination of bureaucratic issues and a stagnant U.S.-China exchange rate, while rates for the euro and Australian dollar have declined. A June 2017 memorandum of understanding that facilitates the registration of U.S. dairy facilities as eligible to export to China could lead to an increase in trade.},

However, state-level export data are not readily available. Thus, we provide estimates of state-level alfalfa exports using port data (1994-2001) and Forage Products data (2002-2022) from U.S. trade online to help describe the amount of alfalfa that is being exported at the state level.

Thus international markets for staple agricultural commodities, which have become increasingly important as sources of nutrition for both developing and developed countries over the past 60 years, are likely to become even more important in the future. Free trade policies allow countries to exploit their comparative advantages in economic activity, increasing average per capita incomes, longer term growth rates and a country's capacity to fund social safety nets for the poor. However, many countries abandoned those policies in favor of domestic protections in their efforts to mitigate the effects of short run food crises. The policy challenge is therefore to resolve the tension between optimal long run policies and short run initiatives to address food security concerns.},

This impact was highly skewed across locations: Grids with negligible direct exposure to the US tariffs accounted for 70\% of China’s population. But the tail 2.5\% of China’s population with the highest exposure saw an implied 2.52\% (1.62\%) decrease in income per capita (employment) relative to unaffected grids. These effects were moreover concentrated in locations with a high commuting openness. By contrast, we do not find significant effects from China’s retaliatory tariffs, and offer evidence of several channels through which the impact on imported inputs was mitigated. In a parallel analysis at the prefecture level, we confirm that the US tariffs had discernible negative aggregate consequences.},

Given that agriculture is the largest consumptive use of water in the state, one anticipated response to a severe drought would be to decrease production of low-value, high-water-use crops such as alfalfa. In this article we use a multimethod approach to examine both spatial distribution and public perceptions of alfalfa production in California over the course of the 2011 through 2017 drought. We find that although California alfalfa production did decline at the state level, it persisted and even increased in specific areas of the state. We also find that alfalfa persisted even though discourses and understandings that were critical of alfalfa production emerged in public forums during this time. We situate these findings within a broader context of California’s water management system, which meant that in practice, infrastructure and water rights allocation practices left many growers with little incentive to change growing practices, even in the face of serious meteorological drought.},

	abstract = {In the United States, like in other countries, the agrifood supply chain faces challenges from a growing population and less predictable weather conditions. Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1\% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5\% to 0.7\% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04\%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination. These findings provide important insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders willing to reduce the food system vulnerability to extreme weather events.},

We find that tariff preferences have been responsible for increased virtual water exports from developing water-scarce countries predominantly located in Africa and Asia. Conversely, tariff preferences are responsible for higher levels of virtual water imports by countries in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East.

	abstract = {Olive oil is the pillar of the agricultural sector in the EU, and olive oil consumption is increasing in the spotlight. There is a gap in previous research regarding the effects of consumer perception and ecological impacts on olive consumption choices. This study recognized the significance of consumer perception in shaping olive oil consumption choice and research gaps in olive ecosystem assessment. The purpose of the thesis is to reveal the impacts of consumer perception on consumption choice using choice experiment data, and olive ecological influence on consumption and environment. So the study used factor analysis to find latent variables and incorporated consumer perception categorization into the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) to explore moderation effects and mediation effects between consumer perception and consumption choice. Furthermore, the study integrated insights from olive ecology through Life cycle Assessment and analyzed environmental impacts. The results showed that the perception of price and health benefits are not the greatest impact on Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) consumption, but the taste and trust of the olive oil products. The regional attributes of olive oil have impacts on consumption choice. In addition, from the farming to packaging and logistics of olive oil, each phase is related to ecology and human well-being to varying degrees. Olive oil producers could consider adapting production and packaging methods and sell strategies to reduce environmental and ecological impacts. Policy intervention should take not only the health benefits and price but also the specific regional conditions and ecological impacts into account when promoting a sustainable olive oil value chain.},

Four models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—were employed to predict whether consumers view Metaverse shopping favorably or unfavorably. Among these, the SVM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 94.17\%, precision of 97.14\%, and an AUC-ROC score of 98.13\%. These results indicate that machine learning can reliably classify consumer perceptions based on demographic and experience-related data. Furthermore, the Random Forest model was used to analyze the importance of features influencing consumer attitudes. The findings revealed that experience-related factors—such as interactivity, personalization, and consumer engagement—were more significant in shaping perceptions than product-specific attributes. The most important feature, MC2 (interactivity), contributed 23.6\% to the model’s predictive power, highlighting the importance of user experience in driving positive sentiment. These insights suggest that businesses aiming to enter the Metaverse retail space should focus on enhancing the overall shopping experience to foster positive consumer perceptions. Machine learning models provide valuable tools for understanding consumer behavior and tailoring virtual shopping environments accordingly. This research offers a data-driven approach to predicting and understanding consumer perceptions of the Metaverse, providing actionable insights for businesses in this emerging market.},

	abstract = {The goal of PLS path modeling is primarily to estimate the variance of endogenous constructs and in turn their respective manifest variables (if reflective). Models with significant jackknife or bootstrap parameter estimates may still be considered invalid in a predictive sense. In this chapter, the objective is to shift from that of assessing the significance of parameter estimates (e.g., loadings and structural paths) to that of predictive validity. Specifically, this chapter examines how predictive indicator weights estimated for a particular PLS structural model are when applied on new data from the same population. Bootstrap resampling is used to create new data sets where new R-square measures are obtained for each endogenous construct in a model. The weighted summed (WSD) R-square represents how well the original sample weights predict when given new data (i.e., a new bootstrap sample). In contrast, the simple summed (SSD) R-square examines the predictiveness using the simpler approach of unit weights. Such an approach is equivalent to performing a traditional path analysis using simple summed scale scores. A relative performance index (RPI) based on the WSD and SSD estimates is created to represent the degree to which the PLS weights yield better predictiveness for endogenous constructs than the simpler procedure of performing regression after simple summing of indicators. In addition, a Performance from Optimized Summed Index (PFO) is obtained by contrasting the WSD R-squares to the R-squares obtained when the PLS algorithm is used on each new bootstrap data set. Results from two studies are presented. In the first study, 14 data sets of sample size 1,000 were created to represent two different structural models (i.e., medium versus high R-square) consisting of one endogenous and three exogenous constructs across seven different measurement scenarios (e.g., parallel versus heterogenous loadings). Five-hundred bootstrap cross validation data sets were generated for each of 14 data sets. In study 2, simulated data based on the population model conforming to the same scenarios in study 1 were used instead of the bootstrap samples in part to examine the accuracy of the bootstrapping approach. Overall, in contrast to Q-square which examines predictive relevance at the indicator level, the RPI and PFO indices are shown to provide additional information to assess predictive relevance of PLS estimates at the construct level. Moreover, it is argued that this approach can be applied to other same set data indices such as AVE (Fornell C, Larcker D, J Mark Res 18:39–50, 1981) and GoF (Tenenhaus M, Amato S, Esposito Vinzi V, Proceedings of the XLII SIS (Italian Statistical Society) Scientific Meeting, vol.

	abstract = {This article examines how international trade and policy shape the economic consequences of climate-induced changes in crop productivity, considering both adaptation and mitigation. International trade serves as a global risk-sharing mechanism with the potential of ameliorating the adverse impacts of climate-induced crop shortages by allowing regions with agricultural surpluses to provide for those facing shortages. However, the effectiveness of trade in adaptation depends on whether changes in productivity occur in the short- or the long-run, the structure of tariffs and subsidies, and whether a country is a net importer or exporter of affected products. The most recent evidence on long-term adaptation suggests that the changes in domestic crop portfolios and a diversified set of suppliers are the most effective ways for food-dependent countries to adapt to projected changes in climate toward the mid-century. In the short term, trade helps to buffer against seasonal price shocks, offering relief from sudden price spikes in food staples. Concerns about importing price volatility have little support in the historical record. Still, they may be justified as shifts in climate may result in more frequent extreme events affecting large producing regions of the world. Emerging international trade policies aimed at climate change mitigation, such as carbon border adjustments and laws banning trade in products associated with deforestation, are gaining traction. The adaptability of the international trade regime to these policies remains uncertain. Critical areas for further research include moving from impact assessment to analyzing how the current structure of farm programs worldwide interacts with adaptation and mitigation strategies, expanding the range of crops, and including livestock products in the analysis.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
To meet the nutritional and environmental needs of a growing population, dairy producers must increase milk production while minimizing the farm-gate environmental impact and adapting to the effects of climate change.
OBJECTIVE
Here we comprehensively assess the effects of climate change on the environmental performance and productivity of three typical US dairy farms, and evaluate the potential benefits of adaptation strategies and implementation of Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) for mitigating these effects and the potential increases in environmental impact.
METHODS
Using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM), we predicted the productivity and environmental impact of these baseline farms under current emission scenarios and climate projections of 6 general circulation models (GCM), for high and low emission scenarios. We simulated farm-specific BMPs for current and future climate conditions for both unadapted and ‘adapted’ field cultivation plans, based on experiences from other climate locations. Finally, the IFSM predictions were compared to those of two other process-based models to test result robustness.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We find that the environmental impact of the three northern US dairy farms (New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) generally increases by mid-century, if no mitigation measures are taken. Overall, feed production is maintained, as decreased corn grain yields are compensated by increased forage yields. Adoption of farm-specific Beneficial Management Practices can substantially reduce the GHG emissions and nutrient losses from dairy farms under current climate conditions and stabilize the environmental impact in future climate conditions, while maintaining farm productivity (milk and feed production). A comparison of three models corroborates the estimated reductions in methane and ammonia emissions associated with BMPs, as well as the relative trend in P-loss reduction.
SIGNIFICANCE
This study provides a holistic assessment of the impacts of climate change on dairy production systems focusing on both feed production and environmental impacts. It demonstrates the interest of BMPs to both reduce GHG emissions and contribute to more resilient farming systems in a changing climate.},

We investigate the extent of output market power exerted in EU dairy processing, applying an advanced stochastic frontier approach to estimate firm-level markups of price over marginal cost using data for France, Italy and Spain from 2008 to 2017. We further relate markups to firm characteristics to identify what type of dairy processors possess the highest power in the sector. Our findings only reveal small average deviations from perfect competition but we find considerable heterogeneity of markups within and between the three countries. We identify a strong positive relationship between markup and profitability, though we find firm size and markups to be inversely related. This indicates that small firms operating in differentiated niche markets are able to charge higher markups, thereby ensuring their profitability. This result can serve EU dairy processors for future strategic alignment, and is particularly interesting from a policy perspective as large firms are mostly blamed in the exercise of market power in public and policy debates.},

The dairy industry (DI), as one of the major consumers of freshwater, generates substantial whey dairy effluent, which is notably rich in organic matter and thus a significant pollutant. The effluent represents environmental risks due to its high biological and chemical oxygen demands. Today, stringent government regulations, environmental laws, and heightened consumer health awareness are compelling industries to responsibly manage and reuse whey waste.

These innovations offer promising sustainable waste management strategies for the dairy sector, aligning with economic interests. The main objectives of the study deal with, (a) assessing the environmental impact of dairy sector waste, (b) exploring the multifaceted nutritional and health benefits inherent in cheese whey, and (c) investigating diverse biotechnological approaches to fashion value-added, eco-friendly dairy whey-based products for potential integration into various food products, and thus fostering economic sustainability.

	abstract = {The US dairy industry has made substantial gains in reducing the greenhouse gas emission intensity of a gallon of milk. At the same time, consumer and investor interest for improved environmental benefits or reduced environmental impact of food production continues to grow. Following a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emission commitments for businesses across sectors of the economy, the US dairy industry has committed to a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Paris Climate Accord's goal is to reduce warming of the atmosphere to less than 1.5 to 2°C based on preindustrial levels, which is different from emission goals of historic climate agreements that focus on emission reduction targets. Most of the emissions that account for the greenhouse gas footprint of a gallon of milk are from the short-lived climate pollutant CH4, which has a half-life of approximately 10 yr. The relatively new accounting system Global Warming Potential Star and the unit CO2 warming equivalents gives the industry the appropriate metrics to quantify their current and projected warming impact on future emissions. Incorporating this metric into potential future emissions pathways can allow the industry to understand the magnitude of emissions reductions needed to no longer contribute additional warming. Deterministic modeling was performed across the dairy industry's emission areas of enteric fermentation, manure management, feed production, and other upstream emissions necessary for dairy production. By reducing farm-level absolute emissions by 23\% based on current levels, there is the opportunity for the US dairy industry to realize climate neutrality within the next few decades.},

This paper examines determinants of dairy-product trade by applying the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) method to the gravity model using panel data on 49 exporting and 235 importing countries for the 17 years from 2000 to 2016. The gravity model is estimated using both interval data and dynamic analyses. The results show that domestic subsidies have a modest, but significant, impact on dairy-product trade across the models. For example, a 1\% increase in subsidies leads to a roughly 0.02\% increase in trade for an average country. Memberships in trade agreements, market size factors, and government institutions also positively affect dairy-product trade. However, tariffs are insignificant in the main model specification. Results from the lag-policy analysis show that the impact of subsidies disappears after the second year of distribution; whereas for the lead-policy analysis, results suggest at least 3 years of anticipatory effects on domestic subsidies.},

	abstract = {Dairy farms in the United States are diverse and although regional dairy production and farm strategy has been evaluated for environmental impact, a comprehensive national assessment is important to define national priorities for sustainable intensification. We estimated important environmental footprints of dairy production using process-level simulation and cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment. Dairy farms representing the sizes and management practices found in six regions were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). Regional and national environmental footprints were determined as an average of all simulated farms weighted by the portion of milk contributed by each to the total. Nationally, dairy farms were found to emit 99,000 ± 8480 Gg CO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG), equivalent to 1.5\% of the estimated U.S. total GHG emission, with a commodity-based intensity of 1.01 ± 0.09 kg CO2e/kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) produced. Fossil energy use was 242,700 ± 38,400 TJ, 0.3\% of the U.S. total, or 2.48 ± 0.39 MJ/kg FPCM. Blue (non-precipitation) water use was 11,600 ± 2480 Tg, roughly 3.0\% of the estimated U.S. total freshwater withdraw, with an intensity of 119 ± 25 kg/kg FPCM. While these environmental footprints represent a small portion of the respective national inventories, the dairy industry's contribution to reactive nitrogen (N) losses appears to be considerably greater. Losses of reactive N were estimated at 970 ± 133 Gg, with an intensity of 9.92 ± 1.36 g/kg FPCM where 66\% of the total was in the form of ammonia (NH3). Although there are no national estimates of total reactive N loss, dairy farms were found to contribute 19–24\% of national inventories of NH3 emissions. While strategies are available to reduce NH3 emissions, finding economical and sustainable solutions that do not result in pollution swapping remains a challenge for the dairy industry.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
To promote circularity in agricultural systems, the utilization of aquatic vegetation for ecological wastewater treatment is a potential mechanism to capture and upcycle nutrients. Agricultural wastewater is an excellent growing medium for aquatic plants like duckweed, offering opportunities for wastewater treatment and conversion of harvested biomass into bio-based products, including protein-rich livestock feed, which can potentially replace conventional soil-based crops such as alfalfa.
OBJECTIVE
We hypothesize that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings to the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) can be reduced via replacing alfalfa cultivation with manure-grown duckweed by: a) reducing excess manure application on agricultural fields; b) reducing synthetic fertilizer application on alfalfa croplands; and c) decreasing the release of fixed N back into the environment from the decomposition of alfalfa crop residue.
METHODS
This study developed an optimization framework to identify locations where alfalfa-to-duckweed replacement could be theoretically employed to minimize N and P loads into the CBW. A relative effectiveness (RE) indicator representing landscape-specific nutrient delivery capacity was included within the framework. Using county-level data on alfalfa yields, cropping area, and nutrient inputs from alfalfa croplands and dairy manure, we identified alfalfa cultivation areas that could be removed and replaced with full or partial duckweed cultivation and land conservation for optimal benefits.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
At the county scale, counties in Pennsylvania (especially Lancaster and adjacent regions) with widespread farming operations and high RE values consistently indicated the greatest benefit by replacing large areas of alfalfa cultivation ({\textgreater} 80\% in each county) with duckweed. Using nutrient load minimization as the primary objective function, a 2.9\% N reduction and 2.4\% P reduction can be achieved at the watershed scale by converting only 7.6\% of the total alfalfa cropland area into duckweed farms. Upon introducing production cost minimization as a competing second objective function, up to 12.8\% N reduction and 9.2\% P reduction are possible with a 40\% decrease in the alfalfa cropping area. A 10-year economic analysis demonstrated the possibility for superior return on investment with this approach, leading to almost seven times the baseline net revenue with alfalfa production, primarily attributed to the higher protein content and corresponding revenue potential of duckweed.
SIGNIFICANCE
Many different constraints on alfalfa production (ex., maintaining some baseline production) and duckweed replacement strategies (ex., utilization of decommissioned alfalfa area vs. soil conservation) were used in this study, which offer a wide range of optimal solutions that consider both environmental and economic tradeoffs.},

	abstract = {Alfalfa is an important crop for the seven western states in the U.S. However, price reporting is inconsistent across the states and there is no futures market for alfalfa hay. This creates price uncertainty within these hay markets. This paper looks at how closely alfalfa hay prices in one state track with hay prices in another state. Further, the paper seeks to determine what factors have influenced alfalfa hay prices over time. Alfalfa prices for the last 30 years, 1992-2021, for each of the seven western states of Arizona (AZ), California (CA), Idaho (ID), Nevada (NV), Oregon (OR), Utah (UT), and Washington (WA) were analyzed and compared. The hay prices between the states are correlated between 0.85 and 0.96. California and Oregon had the highest prices over time and Idaho and Utah had the lowest prices. A regression model was developed to explain what factors influence western state alfalfa hay prices. The findings indicate that larger May 1 hay stocks for the seven-state total leads to lower alfalfa hay prices. Additionally, increased hay exports increase hay prices. Higher corn, feeder cattle and milk prices all positively impact alfalfa hay prices with corn having the biggest impact and milk prices having the smallest impact},

	abstract = {Although alfalfa, or lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), is frequently characterized as a ‘low value’ crop, this is a misnomer. Alfalfa forage is frequently the number three economic crop in the US, with corn and soybean \#1 and 2. However, this valuation does not include the wider economic value of the food end-products that nourish consumers each day originating with alfalfa. Alfalfa is an ‘engine of food production’, and on-farm profitability can sometimes rival that of high value crops such as processing tomato. High yield is the primary driver for economic value in alfalfa hay. Since high yields are positively correlated with healthy deep root systems, excellent stand density, soil conservation, stand longevity, high CO2 fixation and high levels of N2 fixation, high yields of intensive alfalfa production also contribute to environmental goals. These environmental services often go unrecognized, but include soil health, benefits to crop rotations, wildlife habitat, and reduction of the applications of fossil-fuel fertilizers. These benefits are well-known to farmers, but are rarely valued by our society as a whole and minimally monetized. Although the crop is often criticized for its water-wasting ways, the reverse is actually true: the deep roots, high water use efficiency, salinity tolerance, and (most importantly) its ability to produce some economic yield when water supplies are scares make alfalfa an important component for a water-challenged future. ‘Profitable alfalfa production sustains the environment’ – the title of this year’s Alfalfa Congress is a statement of fact as well as a vision for the future.},

	abstract = {Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the most valuable forage crop grown on approximately 30 m ha (74 million acres) worldwide. It is the third most valuable crop harvested in the U.S. behind only corn and soybeans. Alfalfa is widely recognized as a significant component of most dairy and other animal rations because of the multiple benefits it provides: Alfalfa adds valuable fiber, has a faster rate of fiber digestion than grasses, is very palatable, is high in protein, provides needed vitamins, is a good buffer in the rumen, and promotes animal health. In addition, it provides legume nitrogen credits and has rotational yield boost to following crops. It provides environmental benefits in soil remediation, reduced erosion (compared to row crops), and supports varied wildlife by being a source of cover and food from insects, spiders, mites, and earthworms. A major issue is low yield, where the record alfalfa yield in the U.S. is 26 t/a DM with irrigation in Arizona while the average alfalfa yield on a farm in the U.S. is about 4.5 tons/acre DM. The yield problem is a combination of environmental and management issues. Breeding objectives should continue to be resistance to diseases and insects. However, a major long-term direction should be to increase alfalfa yield. Possibly each of the following breeding objectives could contribute: raise limits to natural photosynthesis, reduce dark respiration, develop cultivars that have less leaf loss during harvest, and minimizing the impact of wheel traffic on stands. An additional breeding objective should be to increase the bypass protein of alfalfa. While this will not affect yield, it will increase alfalfa value to users.},

	abstract = {Two primary roughages used for diets of dairy cows are corn silage (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). A dairy forage system model was used to compare the relative merits of these two forages when varied amounts (none, one-third, two-thirds, and all on a dry matter basis) of the forage requirement were ammoniated corn silage and the remainder was alfalfa. Primary comparisons were the net return above feed and manure costs, but manure management issues and labor requirements were also considered. Economic comparisons were made for representative farms using a partial budget analysis synthesized from research reports and surveys. The highest net return was from alfalfa at 100\% of the forage requirement, but differences in net returns across forage systems were small compared with the variation caused by weather among years. Changes in assumptions concerning farm size, soil type, crop yield, milk production, relative prices, and manure handling did not affect the conclusions of the analysis. In systems that used all alfalfa forage, much of the manure was applied to alfalfa crops, a practice that is normally discouraged because the manure reduces weed control, stand persistence, and yield. With alfalfa at 100\% of the forage requirement, large amounts of excess manure nitrogen were produced on the farm. Application of nitrogen to alfalfa must be compensated by a reduced nitrogen fixation to avoid ground water contamination. Because of the lack of a strong economic advantage among the forage systems, the practice of having at least one-third of the forage requirement provided by each of the forage crops is favored to improve management of crops, manure disposal, and labor.},

	abstract = {Alfalfa has been vilified as one of the thirstiest crops in the semi-arid southwestern USA and partially responsible for decreased water security in the Colorado, Rio Grande and San Joaquin River basins. We demonstrate that adoption of summer deficit irrigation in alfalfa production can yield large water savings and flexibility to adapt to changing water supplies with minimal on-field economic impact. We estimate that deficit irrigation of alfalfa can save 1333 to 4157 million cubic meters of water annually (16–50 \% of total alfalfa water use) over 926,000 ha in the southwestern USA if summer deficit irrigation (suspended after July 1) were implemented. Cash-flow analyses, assuming a producer sells conserved irrigation water and forfeits revenue from alfalfa sales beyond August 1, indicate a possible win-win net benefit at a price point of greater than \$71 (Tulare, CA) or \$44 (Imperial, CA) per 1000 m3 of irrigation water. We document the benefits of summer deficit irrigation for water conservation and farm and regional agricultural economic viability in rural communities. We acknowledge its practical challenges and risks as it will require infrastructure for water trading, support systems and mechanisms for producer decision-making, and improvements to field-level water accounting. These findings underscore the need to reassess the role of alfalfa in water management, not just as a water-intensive crop but also as a flexible one that may be a key instrument in achieving agricultural resilience against the backdrop of climate variability and recurring droughts.},

	abstract = {In China, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) often grows in marginal land with poor soil fertility and suboptimal climate conditions. Alfalfa production cannot meet demands both in yield and quality. It is necessary to apply fertilizers to achieve high yields and produce high-quality alfalfa in China. However, there is no understanding on the impact of fertilizer application on alfalfa production and the possible optimal application rates across China. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the contribution of fertilizer application to the yield and quality of alfalfa based on a dataset from 86 studies published between 2004 and 2022. The results showed that fertilizer application not only increased alfalfa yield by 19.2\% but also improved alfalfa quality by increasing crude protein (CP) by 7.7\% and decreasing acid detergent fibre by 2.9\% and neutral detergent fibre by 1.8\% overall compared to the non-fertilizer control levels. The combined nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and combined NP fertilizer applications achieved the greatest yield and CP concentration increases of 27.0\% and 13.5\%, respectively. Considering both yield and quality, the optimal rate of fertilizer application ranged from 30 to 60 kg ha-1 for N, 120 to 150 kg ha-1 for P and less than 120 kg ha-1 for K. Meta-analysis further showed that the effect of fertilizer application on yield was greater in low soil organic matter (SOM) soils than in high SOM soils. In conclusion, fertilizer application is an effective strategy to improve the yield and quality of alfalfa in China, especially that grown in low SOM soils. This study is helpful for optimizing fertilization schedules of alfalfa in China.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to review the growth and regional disparities of China's dairy market since 1980, examine urban consumer demand for three major dairy products (fluid milk, yogurt, and milk powder), analyze China's import patterns of major dairy products since 1995, and discuss China's potential roles in the world dairy market and implications for trade.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              While the most recently available time‐series and cross‐sectional data from China are used to analyze the trends and disparities of China's milk production and dairy product consumption through graphical and regression analyses, China's custom data from 1995 to 2008 are used to examine the trends and patterns of China's dairy product imports.
            
            
              Findings
              China's dairy market has expanded rapidly in the past two decades but there are significant disparities across regions and income groups. The estimated income elasticities suggest that, as per capita income continues to increase, the demand for dairy products, especially yogurt and fluid milk, is expected to grow at a significant rate. The import trend and pattern analysis indicates that China's dairy imports will likely continue to grow and provide opportunities for major dairy product exporters like the USA, New Zealand, and Australia.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper contributes to the literature by examining the trends and disparities of China's dairy market using the most recently available data, presenting an estimation of demand elasticities for fluid milk, yogurt, and milk powder in urban China, and discussing the future prospects of China's dairy imports and implications for trade.},

	abstract = {This study examines the development and trends of China’s alfalfa market and imports, identifies key factors for the rapid increase in China’s alfalfa imports, and discusses potential impacts of the U.S.–China trade dispute and retaliations on the alfalfa markets and trade in both nations. China’s rapid transition toward larger-scale commercial dairy production, with enhanced feed and cost management as well as quality and safety control, and its limited resources for high-quality alfalfa production are key factors for the dramatic increase in its alfalfa imports, from 19 601 metric tons in 2008 to 1.38 million metric tons (mmt) in 2018. While the United States dominated China’s alfalfa imports with an average share of 97.01\% from 2007 to 2017, the share dropped to 83.76\% in 2018 and 63.28\% in January 2019 due to the trade dispute and retaliations started in 2018. China will likely remain a large importer of alfalfa because of both its growing demand and the comparative advantages of imported alfalfa in quality and price, but the imports from the United States will be highly affected by the ongoing trade dispute and negotiations. China is also expected to make more efforts to reduce its dependence on U.S. alfalfa through increased investment in domestic alfalfa production and identification of alternative sources of alfalfa and other hay imports.},

Therefore, the full incidence of the tariffs has fallen on domestic consumers and importers so far, and our estimates imply a reduction in aggregate US real income of \$1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We see similar patterns for foreign countries that have retaliated with their own tariffs against the United States, which suggests that the trade war has also reduced the real income of these other countries.},

	abstract = {This article attempts to examine the current US-China trade war. It argues that the trade war cannot achieve the outcomes that President Donald Trump desires and it could be avoided by resolving the structural trade imbalances and undertaking enduring and effective strategic communications. First, the trade war cannot significantly reduce or eliminate the current account deficit of the US. The capital account can drive the current account, and the US capital account surpluses persist due to the country?s sublime capital markets and inflows of foreign excess savings. Second, it is almost impossible to impede China?s technological advancement. Technology development can increase China?s gross output, especially the wages of skilled labourers, which is essential for China?s much-needed consumption-driven economy. This, in turn, is crucial for reducing China?s excess savings. The Chinese government possesses an unyielding determination and capacity to advance technologies. It is worth noting that stifling China?s technological advancement will likely to be detrimental to the aim of trade rebalancing. Pursuing the goals simultaneously ? fixing the trade imbalances and halting China?s technological advancement ? will be challenging as they are counteractive. Surely, the trade war strikes the vulnerable Chinese economy. In order to fix the trade imbalances as well as to end and avoid the war, China must step up economic reforms. In the immediate run, it needs to prevent the further devaluation of China?s renminbi (RMB) and raise its interest rate. The US might need to reduce the capital account surpluses by allowing and encouraging foreign central banks to accumulate a synthetic currency instead of the US dollar. It is also imperative that both countries return to the negotiating table. Both countries need to accurately communicate their ?bottom lines? and correctly interpret each other?s signals.},

However, the conditions under which general equilibrium (GE) analysis adds value to welfare analysis for single-sector technology or performance standards, the predominant policy intervention in practice, remains an open question. Using a numerical computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we investigate the GE effects of regulations across different sectors, abatement technologies, and regulatory designs. Our results show that even for small regulations GE effects are significant, and engineering estimates of compliance costs can substantially underestimate the social cost of single-sector environmental regulations. We find the downward bias from using engineering costs to approximate social costs depends on the input composition of abatement technologies and the regulated sector.},

Either a regional household approach or separate accounts for government and potentially multiple private households with related closures are available. Supply and factor markets can be dis-aggregated to sub-regions and an implementation for GTAP-AEZ is available. We compare the layout of different well-known global and single country CGE models and discuss to what extent our flexible framework can replicate these layouts. In a structural sensitivity analysis, we compare major results under multi-lateral trade liberalization and endowment changes in one country for different model configurations. These reflect important structural differences between the chosen examples as well as additional features such as the Melitz model or endogenous capital stocks driven by investments in a comparative-static setting. We find relative limited differences in global and regional welfare between models based on the Armington assumption, even if other features differ such as closures, nestings or functional form in demand. A discussion on further joint development of such a framework leads to our summary and conclusions.},

These methods called Economic-Environment Integrated Models (EEIM) are based on the coupling of formalised economic modelling tools with environmental assessment methods. The economic modelling tools considered are Input Output (IO) models, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Partial Equilibrium (PE) models, Agent-Based models (ABM), and System Dynamics (SD) models, which we pair with environmental assessment methods such as Footprints (FP), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), or Material Flow Analysis (MFA). A grid of criteria is developed to perform a qualitative rating of the EEIMs according to existing literature. The grid encompasses the detail level of the economic modelling, the level of coupling between environmental and economic tools, the quality and diversity of indicators, the ability to account for diverse indirect effects, spatial differentiation, time aspects, and the coupled model usability. First, the results show that the couplings do not perform on the same criteria, which shows complementarity to deal with diverse issues. Second, overall, for most criteria, PE/CGE models coupled with FP/LCA ranked highest. Third, a few case studies showed that couplings involving a third tool can be beneficial— for instance AB modelling or MFA with PE/CGE-LCA/FP may allow to overcome some shortcomings such as agent behaviour modelling or data availability for biophysical flows.},

The exposure of agricultural production systems to hurricanes varies between regions in contrast to global risks like commodity price volatility and international trade policies. The regional differences in hurricane exposure may lead to heterogeneity in crop insurance premium rates. This work aims to measure the impact of hurricane incidence on production losses for crops grown in the Mississippi Delta. We leverage a county-month panel of insurance losses spanning 2002–2021 from the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency, and daily data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane Center, to construct novel measures for hurricane treatment assignment under a difference-in-differences identification strategy. We find hurricane incidence results in economically significant losses that are strikingly heterogeneous across crops. We also demonstrate that measuring hurricane treatment is a critical concern for credible identification as simplistic approaches are associated with attenuation bias relative to our approach which accounts for the dynamic changes in the scope and intensity of a hurricane. We discuss implications of these results for two important policy instruments, traditional crop insurance premium rating and the more recently released Hurricane Insurance Protection—Wind Index product.},

	abstract = {State and federal governments spend billions of dollars on agricultural conservation programs that provide subsidies to agricultural producers for on-farm actions to improve environmental outcome. Evaluating these programs is econometrically complex due to the voluntary nature of participation and the “black box” evaluation of applicants. These challenges make it difficult to evaluate the realized effects on natural resources. Programs may have unintended consequences. Behavioral responses to efficiency improvements, for example, may cause a rebound effect in resource use, eroding potential benefits. I use granular applicant-level data for California’s State Water Efficiency and Enhancement Program (SWEEP) to account for program selection combined with large volume field-level geospatial data to estimate whether receiving irrigation efficiency subsidies result in adjustments to production decisions that may cause a rebound effect. Across the entire set of applicants, on average, I find that program enrollment has no significant effect on crop choice or water use. However, I find important heterogeneities in program impacts. Having access to surface water leads to funded applicants switching to more water-intensive crops compared to their unfunded counterparts. Funded projects that install micro irrigation technologies are effective in reducing consumptive water use however these effects are entirely offset by those projects that do not install micro irrigation technologies and, in fact, increase their consumptive water use. The purpose of SWEEP is to reduce water use and energy use. These results highlight key issues related to conservation program targeting. SWEEP funds a broad range of potential technologies, some of which reduce water use, but ultimately funding decisions are not made along the margins that most significantly increase water conservation.},

	abstract = {Cropland is a main source of global nitrogen pollution1,2. Mitigating nitrogen pollution from global croplands is a grand challenge because of the nature of non-point-source pollution from millions of farms and the constraints to implementing pollution-reduction measures, such as lack of financial resources and limited nitrogen-management knowledge of farmers3. Here we synthesize 1,521 field observations worldwide and identify 11 key measures that can reduce nitrogen losses from croplands to air and water by 30–70\%, while increasing crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 10–30\% and 10–80\%, respectively. Overall, adoption of this package of measures on global croplands would allow the production of 17 ± 3 Tg (1012 g) more crop nitrogen (20\% increase) with 22 ± 4 Tg less nitrogen fertilizer used (21\% reduction) and 26 ± 5 Tg less nitrogen pollution (32\% reduction) to the environment for the considered base year of 2015. These changes could gain a global societal benefit of 476 ± 123 billion US dollars (USD) for food supply, human health, ecosystems and climate, with net mitigation costs of only 19 ± 5 billion USD, of which 15 ± 4 billion USD fertilizer saving offsets 44\% of the gross mitigation cost. To mitigate nitrogen pollution from croplands in the future, innovative policies such as a nitrogen credit system (NCS) could be implemented to select, incentivize and, where necessary, subsidize the adoption of these measures.},

In response to a series of US tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, China imposed retaliatory tariffs, especially on US agricultural products, which largely affected Republican-leaning counties. The US government then subsidized US farmers by providing direct payments through the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) to mitigate the Chinese retaliatory tariffs. Using the universe of actual county-level MFP disbursement data, we document that MFP payments relative to the Chinese retaliatory tariff exposure were higher in solidly Republican counties, implying that the Trump administration allocated rents in exchange for political patronage. We also find that MFP payments outweighed the estimated impact of Chinese retaliatory tariffs and led to an increase in the Republican vote share in the 2020 presidential election. Finally, we uncover evidence that China's retaliatory trade policy and the corresponding US agricultural policy exacerbated political polarization in the US, especially the rural–urban divide.},

By shifting its production to new locations, and inducing changes in technology and input use, trade has a substantial impact on environmental sustainability of the world’s food systems, but due to suboptimal environmental policy, the exact nature of these impacts is in dispute. We review the literature on agricultural trade and environmental sustainability, highlighting the different approaches taken in ecology versus economics. While useful in identifying environmental costs, much of the ecological literature does not compare these costs to a trade-free counterfactual and can therefore be misleading. Further, by moving production to places with more resources and increasing production efficiency, trade can reduce the environmental impact of food production. On the other hand, trade can also limit the effectiveness of domestic environmental policy because production can be shifted to countries with less stringent regulations. However, recently, consumers are leveraging trade policy to induce exporters to improve environmental sustainability. While such policies are gaining traction in wealthy countries, evidence suggests that such measures will not reach their potential without buy-in from decision makers in the countries where the environmental damages are occurring.},

Yet, no national estimates exist on the effect of fertilizer application on concentrations of agricultural pollutants in US watersheds. This paper employs a watershed-level panel data on nitrogen and phosphorus pollution readings to examine the impact of fertilizer use on US water quality over a fifty-five-year time period from 1951 to 2005. Findings show that a 10\% increase in the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers leads to a 1.52\% increase in the concentration of nitrogen and a 1.37\% increase in the concentration of phosphorus across watersheds. Results also indicate that there exists heterogeneity in nutrient pollution elasticity estimates across eighteen US water resource regions, ranging from 0.082 to 0.733 in the case of nitrogen and from 0.036 to 0.475 in the case of phosphorus. Combining our results with prior hydrology-based studies, we find that a 100\% increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizers in the Lower Mississippi water resource region expands the size of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico by roughly 3,389 square miles, equivalent to about two-fifths of the estimated size of the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.},

	abstract = {After their commercial introduction in 1996, genetically engineered (GE), herbicidetolerant (HT) varieties of corn, soybeans, and cotton were rapidly adopted by U.S. farmers. The success of these GE crops led to the deregulation that enabled the commercialization of HT canola in 1998 and of HT alfalfa and sugarbeets in 2005. Although legal/regulatory issues limited the spread of GE sugarbeets and GE alfalfa during the first decade of the 21st century, adoption rates for these crops have increased rapidly in recent years. This report uses data from USDA’s 2013 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to analyze the adoption of GE alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets in the United States. It also discusses legal/regulatory issues associated with the commercialization of these crops, trends in adoption rates, and the economic impacts of adoption. Some 95 percent of U.S. canola acres and over 99 percent of sugarbeet acres harvested in 2013 were planted with GE seeds containing HT traits. Only 13 percent of U.S. alfalfa acres were planted using GE seeds in 2013, but this slower adoption rate is expected because alfalfa is a perennial crop and only about one-seventh of the alfalfa acreage is newly seeded each year.},

We then calculate the impact of TFP changes on both domestic and global emissions. In a scenario whereby practices reduce TFP by 5\%, consistent with recent findings for cover cropping, we show that the net climate benefits of these practices are reduced in most countries—and by 70\% in the United States and 80\% in Europe.

We methodically extracted trusted pixels as land cover labels from historical CDL datasets, employing Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat-9 as sources for spectrum data, using the random forest classifier to conduct nationwide crop-type classifications. These classifications were integrated into the In-Season Crop Data Layer (ICDL) covering the entire Conterminous United States (CONUS). This approach facilitated the efficient generation of ICDLs for May, June, and July 2022, achieving satisfactory accuracy in July. Compared to Nebraska and Iowa ground truth data, ICDL achieved F1 scores of (0.911, 0.845) for corn and (0.959, 0.969) for soybean. Furthermore, ICDL’s regional acreage estimates for major crops (corn, soybean, spring wheat, cotton, winter wheat, and rice) closely align with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) figures, showing minimal variances as low as (0.01\%, −0.68\%, 0.19\%, −4.39\%, −5.78\%, −1.28\%). Notably, ICDL outperforms CDL in most assessments. This research consistently produces annual ICDLs from May to July that are readily accessible to the public in the iCrop system. Simultaneously, it presents an alternative technique for nationwide, in-season mapping of crop types.},

            Payment for environmental service contracts commonly require actions beyond adoption of a practice, such as undergoing specified enrollment procedures, granting consent to being monitored, and paying penalties for violations. These provisions are a bundle of attributes a landholder must accept with contract enrollment, leading to transaction costs in the contracting process. This article develops a principal–agent framework to study the links between these transaction costs and the well‐known information asymmetries between the landholders and the government agency offering contracts. Using stated choice data collected from a sample of farmers, we estimate a mixed logit model to quantify the contribution of different contract attributes on contract willingness‐to‐accept (WTA). More stringent provisions in contracts were found to raise individual WTA by widely differing amounts across farmers, but the average effects imply that overall contract supply is sensitive to stringency. From a series of microsimulations based on the estimated model, we find that transaction costs create a significant drain on the cost‐effectiveness of contracting from the agency's point of view, similar in magnitude to the inefficiency created by hidden information. Although stringent contractual terms raise program expenditures, they may be justified if they raise compliance rates enough to offset the added cost. We also simulate an implicit frontier to trace out the change in compliance needed to justify a given increase in stringency. For environmental benefits in the range of previous estimates, this analysis suggests that stringent terms would need to substantially raise compliance rates to be cost effective.},

Evidence for these effects has thus far been scant, contributing to polarized perceptions about the potential for improving agricultural technologies as a means to slow down deforestation. We find that, in most countries of the world, growth in total factor productivity (TFP) is either uncorrelated or is positively associated with cropland expansion. Yet worldwide TFP growth have been an important source of global land savings. The divergence between the country-level and the global results is explained by the changes in production patterns as countries interact in international markets. Our preferred point estimate of the elasticity of global cropland to global TFP growth is -0.34. Moreover, we estimate that satisfying food demand from 1991 to 2010 without observed TFP growth would have necessitated an additional 173 million hectares, or close to 10\% of the area covered by tropical rain forests.},

	abstract = {Despite their global presence and multiple services including water storage and treatment, limited field studies have focused on quantifying water quality effectiveness of agricultural stormwater detention areas (SDAs; farm ponds). Limited data available comes from unverified modeling studies. Economics is another neglected aspect of SDAs. An SDA in the Everglades basin of Florida was monitored to quantify its baseline nitrogen (N) treatment. Design flaws of underutilized surface storage in variably ponded areas and short-circuiting were rectified by retrofitting the SDA through compartmentalization, increase in outflow structure control elevation, and installing channel plugs. Post the retrofits, total N retentions doubled (7500 from 3700 kg), a similar trend was observed with respect to surface water volume indicating that water retention drives N retention. Targeting enhanced water retention through retrofits can achieve reductions in downstream nutrient flows. The cost of additional N treatment from retrofits was \$12/kg, an order of magnitude less than the published costs for other detention systems including newly constructed wetlands (\$180/kg) and tailwater recovery systems (\$214/kg). A scale-up showed that retrofitting SDAs could reduce the N discharge to an estuary in the Everglades basin by over 50 \%. A payoff to the farmers for SDA retrofits through a payment for environmental services program can achieve higher N treatment economically and facilitate large-scale adoption.},

	abstract = {Alfalfa hay is an important crop for the U.S., comprising 15.46 million acres on average over the last three years (2020-2022). In 2019, the farm value of alfalfa slightly exceeded wheat to be the third most valuable crop in the U.S., behind corn and soybeans. Alfalfa is crucial for the dairy industry, feedlot sector, equine industries, and agricultural exports. Alfalfa exports have been criticized as their source can be from water-scarce states. However, state-level export data are not readily available. Thus, we provide estimates of state-level alfalfa exports using port data (1994-2001) and Forage Products data (2002-2022) from U.S. trade online to help describe the amount of alfalfa that is being exported at the state level. We also provide estimates of the amount of water utilized by alfalfa exports for the seven exporting states using a range of water use estimates from various sources and USDA/NASS data.},

Index-based insurance products, like the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage Insurance Program, are considered to be an adaptation strategy for mitigating climatic risks. Given that indices are imperfect predictors of losses, residual (basis) risk persists. This study quantifies basis risk and assesses insurance contract quality for nearly 63 million acres of rangelands in California. Basis risk can be summarized by considering false negative probabilities—the probability that an insured producer suffers a loss without receiving an indemnity payment. On California rangelands the false negative probabilities associated with one (both) of insured time intervals failing to indemnify a loss are 31\% to 46\% (14\%–25\%). When indemnities were paid, in 36\% of the cases the payments are not sufficient to compensate for forage-related losses; the average shortfall in indemnity-related compensation ranged from {\textbackslash}1.74/acre to {\textbackslash}2.73/acre depending upon the location and underlying value of forage.},

This paper develops a spatial model of the U.S. dairy supply chain to investigate the effects of longstanding milk pricing rules enforced by the eleven Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) on the geography of milk production and processing, inter-regional farm milk shipments, international trade, and welfare. While our simulation results comport with the standard finding that FMMOs transfer surplus from domestic beverage milk consumers to dairy farms, we find welfare effects to be small as a share of revenue, with notable regional differences. Upon removal of the regional pricing rules, production of farm milk falls across all marketing order regions, with the largest decline occurring in the Southwest (7\%). Shipments of farm milk as a share of production increase slightly, indicating that policy-induced market distortions are not the source of what might appear as excessive inter-regional milk trade.},

We find that losses in foreign trade with retaliatory countries outweigh the gains from trade with non-retaliatory countries by more than USD 14.4 billion. Our results also indicate that nonretaliatory countries accommodated the increased demand from retaliatory countries by reorienting their trade relationships. We find that countries in South America and Europe benefited the most from these adjustments gaining more than USD 13.5 billion in additional foreign sales.

Our study uncovered empirical evidence of the PAR program’s impact on forest quality. Through a multiperiod difference-in-differences analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we found that the PAR program significantly curbed deforestation in the participating counties and reduced forest-clearing activities among the resettled households, even those relocating to rural villages. Mechanism analysis revealed that the program discouraged deforestation by enhancing market accessibility, fostering nonfarm employment opportunities, and elevating income levels. The study underscores that altering livelihood strategies and lifestyles is essential for resettlement programs to effectively mitigate ecological degradation.},

	abstract = {Land-use change such as the conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land has been a major driver of global biodiversity loss, prompting efforts at biodiversity restoration. However, restoration measures in certain areas can shift the detrimental biodiversity impacts elsewhere through the outsourcing of agri-food supply chains to biodiverse regions. This study examines the link between biodiversity impacts from land-use change and shifts in global supply chains from 1995 to 2022 by introducing a marginal allocation into multiregional input–output analysis. Almost 80\% of recent global land-use change impacts were associated with increased agri-food exports from Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia + Pacific (excluding China). Conversely, increased imports to China, the United States, Europe and the Middle East accounted for almost 60\% of recent global land-use change impacts from a consumption perspective, despite decreasing domestic impacts through restoration. Decreasing biodiversity impacts in temperate and arid regions have been partially achieved by outsourcing agri-food supply to tropical biodiversity hotspots. This results in a cumulated global extinction rate (1.4\% global potential species loss since 1995), exceeding the planetary boundary by about fifty times, thus highlighting the need for policies incentivizing habitat protection in tropical regions and sustainable sourcing in agri-food supply chains.},

	abstract = {Since the commercialization of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant (GT) crops in the mid-1990s, glyphosate has become the dominant herbicide to control weeds in corn, soybean, and other crops in the United States and elsewhere. However, recent public concerns over its potential carcinogenicity in humans have generated calls for glyphosate-restricting policies. Should a policy to restrict glyphosate use, such as a glyphosate tax, be implemented? The decision involves two types of tradeoffs: human health and environmental (HH-E) impacts versus market economic impacts, and the use of glyphosate versus alternative herbicides, where the alternatives potentially have more serious adverse HH-E effects. Accounting for farmers’ weed management choices, we provide empirical evaluation of the HH-E welfare and market economic welfare effects of a glyphosate use restriction policy on US corn production. Under a glyphosate tax, farmers would substitute glyphosate for a combination of other herbicides. Should a 10\% glyphosate tax be imposed, then the most conservative welfare estimate is a net HH-E welfare gain with a monetized value of US\$6 million per annum but also a net market economic loss of US\$98 million per annum in the United States, which translates into a net loss in social welfare. This result of overall welfare loss is robust to a wide range of tax rates considered, from 10 to 50\%, and to multiple scenarios of glyphosate’s HH-E effects, which are the primary sources of uncertainties about glyphosate’s effects.},

Payments are typically conditional on agreed rules of natural resource management rather than on delivery of the services. The rules range from protection of native ecosystems to installation of conservation practices. The earliest proponents of PES were economists who argued that they are a cost-effective way to conserve forests, manage watersheds, and protect biodiversity. Political support for PES rests on the claim that these programs can alleviate poverty among participants as well as protect the environment. More recent literature and experience with PES reveals barriers to achieving cost-effectiveness and poverty alleviation, including many related to the distribution of participation. The Costa Rican experience illustrates the choices that must be made and the potential for innovation in the design of PES programs.},

However, converting remotely sensed images into measurements of a particular variable is not trivial, as there are more pitfalls and nuances than “meet the eye”. Overall, however, research benefits tremendously from advances in available satellite data as well as complementary tools, such as cloud-based platforms, machine learning algorithms, and econometric approaches. Our goal here is to provide agricultural and environmental economists with an accessible introduction to working with satellite data, show-case applications, discuss pitfalls and available solutions, and emphasize the best practices. This is supported by extensive supporting information, where we describe how to create different variables, common workflows, and a discussion of required resources and skills.

	abstract = {Managing sustainable harvest of wildlife populations requires regular collection of demographic data and robust estimates of demographic parameters. Estimates can then be used to develop a harvest strategy to guide decision-making. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are an important species in the Atlantic Flyway for many users and they exhibited exponential growth in the eastern United States between the 1970s and 1990s. Since then, estimates of mallard abundance have declined 16\%, prompting the Atlantic Flyway Council and United States Fish and Wildlife Service to implement more restrictive hunting regulations and develop a new harvest strategy predicated on an updated population model. Our primary objective was to develop an integrated population model (IPM) for use in an eastern mallard harvest management strategy. We developed an IPM using annual estimates of breeding abundance, 2-season banding and recovery data, and hunter-harvest data from 1998 to 2018. When developing the model, we used novel model selection methods to test various forms of a sub-model for survival including estimating the degree of harvest additivity and any age-specific trends. The top survival sub-model included a negative annual trend on juvenile survival. The IPM posterior estimates for population abundance tracked closely with the observed estimates and estimates of mean annual population growth rate ranged from 0.88 to 1.08. Our population model provided increased precision in abundance estimates compared to survey methods for use in an updated harvest strategy. The IPM posterior estimates of survival rates were relatively stable for adult cohorts, and annual growth rate was positively correlated with the female age ratio, a measure of reproduction. Either or both of those demographic parameters, juvenile survival or reproduction, could be a target for management efforts to address the population decline. The resulting demographic parameters provided information on the equilibrium population size and can be used in an adaptive harvest strategy for mallards in eastern North America.},

	abstract = {Bird biodiversity in the United States is declining at alarming rates. Despite concerns about the link between climate change and the decline in bird biodiversity, there is limited understanding of the heterogeneous effects of climate change across species and regions and the extent to which these effects persist over time. Using a longterm dataset of the North American bird population from 1980 to 2015, we find statistically significant and robust evidence that an unconditional one-standard-deviation increase in the days above 25 ◦C (currently 7.8 days in a year but projected to exceed 28 days by the century’s end) decreases bird abundance and species richness by 2.5\% and 1.7\%, respectively; these effects are more pronounced for specialist birds (4.9\% and 2.9\%), long-distance migrant specialist species (5.2\% and 3.2\%), and bird populations in the drier areas, such as the West (7.0\% and 2.5\%). Additionally, we find no evidence of a diminishing impact of high temperatures on bird biodiversity over this period. Projecting forward to the end of this century, our models suggest that, depending on the extent of warming, the abundance and species richness of specialist birds could decline by 7\%-16\% and 4\%-9\%, respectively, relative to current levels. Though less pronounced, a statistically significant decline of 1–3\% is also projected for generalist bird populations.},

	abstract = {Land use change is crucial to addressing the existential threats of climate change and biodiversity loss while enhancing food security [M. Zurek et al., Science 376, 1416–1421 (2022)]. The interconnected and spatially varying nature of the impacts of land use change means that these challenges must be addressed simultaneously [H.-O. Pörtner et al., Science 380, eabl4881 (2023)]. However, governments commonly focus on single issues, incentivizing land use change via “Flat-Rate” subsidies offering constant per hectare payments, uptake of which is determined by the economic circumstances of landowners rather than the integrated environmental outcomes that will be delivered [G. Q. Bull et al., Forest Policy Econ. 9, 13–31 (2006)]. Here, we compare Flat-Rate subsidies to two alternatives: “Land Use Scenario” allocation of subsidies through consultation across stakeholders and interested parties; and a “Natural Capital” approach which targets subsidies according to expected ecosystem service response. This comparison is achieved by developing a comprehensive decision support system, integrating new and existing natural, physical, and economic science models to quantify environmental, agricultural, and economic outcomes. Applying this system to the United Kingdom’s net zero commitment to increase carbon storage via afforestation, we show that the three approaches result in significantly different outcomes in terms of where planting occurs, their environmental consequences, and economic costs and benefits. The Flat-Rate approach actually increases net carbon emissions while Land Use Scenario allocation yields poor economic outcomes. The Natural Capital targeted approach outperforms both alternatives, providing the highest possible social values while satisfying net zero commitments.},

	abstract = {Sandstorms, exacerbated by global warming and distinct from industrial sources of air pollution, have significant detrimental effects on various socio-economic factors. However, evidence of their impact on agricultural production and the adaptation strategies employed by farmers remains limited. This paper estimates the impacts of sandstorms on crop yields and examines the associated adaptation strategies. Using data from 288 counties in China's winter wheat production regions spanning 2000 to 2007, we uncover a substantial 14.8\% reduction in winter wheat yields in northern China due to sandstorms. Each additional hour of sandstorm during the winter wheat growing season corresponds to a 1.4\% decrease in yield. Household-level data further reveal that sandstorms not only threaten food security by reducing crop yields, but also lead to a significant decrease in planted areas. Furthermore, we find that farmers increase their investments in fertilizer and labor as adaptation measures to mitigate the negative impacts of sandstorms on crop yields. Our results suggest that timely irrigation following a sandstorm, especially in areas with less precipitation, can effectively mitigate its adverse effects, offering valuable insights for reducing the economic impact of sandstorm events. These findings underscore the need for adaptive strategies to safeguard agricultural productivity in the face of increasing sandstorm risks, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders engaged in agricultural resilience planning.},

We then explain the ways in which protecting biodiversity generates economic benefits in terms of direct and indirect values. Empirical approaches to estimating direct and indirect values are presented, along with a selection of recent evidence on how substantial these values are. The use of asset accounting approaches to track biodiversity values over time is discussed, in the context of sustainable development paths.

Employing bird species and agricultural data in two panel data sets, we evaluate the extent of set-aside's trade-offs in England between 1992 and 2007. Mixed biodiversity outcomes are reflected in a marginal effect, of a 100 ha increase in set-aside, associated with a 1\%–2\% increase in species abundance and richness, no impact on Shannon-Wiener diversity, and a 0.03 standard deviation fall in phylogenetic diversity. Lower phylogenetic diversity indicates that populations of less genetically distinct bird species appear when set-aside increases. These effects are discontinuous for abundance and richness, and larger in the long run than in the short run for richness and phylogenetic diversity. Set-aside led, on average, to a 7\%–9\% fall in cereal land. In turn, this led to an up to 2\% decline in cereal output. A yield increase of 5\%–10\% is likely due to the setting aside of mostly marginal land. Biodiversity–food trade-offs in agricultural landscapes could be minimized with a carefully targeted set-aside policy, based on clearly defined biodiversity goals, and in settings where there is still scope for intensification.},

	abstract = {Land use changes around 26 karstic cave–spring systems in Florida were evaluated using geographic information system. Located in the unconfined or semiconfined zones of the Floridan aquifer, some of the cave–spring systems are directly connected to the surficial land use processes by sinking streams, whereas others receiving diffuse recharge are still vulnerable to contamination due to a thin sandy cover overlying the aquifer. Comparison of nitrate-producing land use practices between 2004 and 2013–2014 shows increasing risks of groundwater contamination in the Floridan aquifer. Proliferation of septic systems and wastewater treatment sites due to growing residential areas, increased use of fertilizers for farming and landscaping stand out as major causes of nitrate overload in the both surface and groundwater.},

	abstract = {Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it  provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

We assessed the US protected area portfolio with respect to biodiversity in the country. New synthesis maps for terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish, and trees permit comparison with protected areas to identify priorities for future conservation investment. Although the total area protected is substantial, its geographic configuration is nearly the opposite of patterns of endemism within the country. Most protected lands are in the West, whereas the vulnerable species are largely in the Southeast. Private land protections are significant, but they are not concentrated where the priorities are. To adequately protect the nation’s unique biodiversity, we recommend specific areas deserving additional protection, some of them including public lands, but many others requiring private investment.},

	abstract = {Endemism and species richness are highly relevant to the global prioritization of conservation efforts in which oceanic islands have remained relatively neglected. When compared to mainland areas, oceanic islands in general are known for their high percentage of endemic species but only moderate levels of species richness, prompting the question of their relative conservation value. Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness (“endemism richness”) of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.},

The voluntary nature of the program and the lack of performance assessment have led to speculations regarding the effectiveness of the program in delivering environmental benefits, in particular for improving water quality. This study provides quantitative estimates of the influence of EQIP payments on local water quality at a national scale. We link monitoring station level water quality readings with EQIP contract data and exploit the direction of river flow for identification. The estimated effects of EQIP vary across water quality measures. Estimates indicate that EQIP payments have significantly reduced biochemical oxygen demand and nitrogen, indicating improvements in water quality, but increased total suspended solids, fecal coliform, and phosphorus, suggesting that the implementation of certain conservation practices might have increased soil erosion and pathogen transfer, especially in watersheds with more agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Hydrological changes can lead to biodiversity responses that are complex and challenging to quantify. We present a framework that uses biodiversity as a criterion to address “where to buy” and “how much to buy” in a payment-for-environmental-services (PES) program focused on water storage service in the Everglades basin, USA. The PES program was designed to pay for added water storage on private cattle ranchlands by raising the spillage level in drainage control structures to reduce surface flows. We predicted that increased hydration of previously drained wetlands would benefit biodiversity, a previously unquantified but desirable co-benefit of the original program, and that a PES program offering bundled services (e.g., storage and biodiversity) can better achieve restoration goals. We quantified desirable biodiversity services (abundance of native flora and fauna such as cover of wetland and forage plants, and abundance of fishes, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates), dis-services (e.g., abundance of invasive plants and mosquitos), and hydrologic signatures (e.g., wetland water depth, inundation area and duration) at four ranches to develop eco-hydrological relationships (models) between hydrological changes and biodiversity responses. Next, a hydrologic model (MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11) was used to predict surface and subsurface water levels and flows and resulting wetland hydrologic signatures for 13 water storage alternatives on the ranches, which were used as example PES proposals. A decision-support-system (DSS) was developed to integrate (i) storage predicted by the hydrologic model, (ii) biodiversity responses predicted by eco-hydrologic models, and (iii) a user-defined preference scheme to assign importance weights to storage, biodiversity, and implementation cost. The DSS calculated a cumulative score for ranking PES proposals. By considering desirable services and dis-services, stakeholders can decide on their preferred level of services, e.g., buyer(s) may settle for less storage if there is a gain in desirable biodiversity. The DSS can identify trade-offs among services, helping stakeholders negotiate.},

	abstract = {This manuscript reports on an effort to account, estimate, and document, to the fullest extent possible, direct payments for ecosystem services to private forest landowners in the United States. This includes payments derived from markets, subsidies, and hybrid approaches, from both governmental and non-governmental sources. Data were compiled from government agencies, public registries, and surveys of market participants. In some cases full reporting of program/market payments and forest area enrolled was possible. In other cases estimation was necessary, including averaging and interpolation by state and year, to create a conservative and comprehensive understanding of the nature, magnitude, and trends of programs and markets that provide payments for forest-based ecosystem services (PFES). Programs and markets were classified by categories of ecosystem services supported (carbon sequestration and storage, water quality and watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and bundled services), as well as payment mechanism (public payments, compliance transactions, and voluntary transactions). Findings show that estimated total PFES averaged \$3.3 billion per year (2015 dollars), or about \$17.69 per hectare of private forest per year over the decade 2010–19. This includes an average of \$176 million per year for carbon, \$889 million per year for water, \$1529 million per year for wildlife habitat, and \$754 million per year for bundled services. Hunting leases in particular are the largest payment source for private forest landowners, and have grown substantially up to \$1.6 billion in 2016. At the same time, compliance and voluntary markets for carbon and water have also grown. In particular, the establishment of a market for carbon offsets within California’s cap-and-trade program has increased the size of forest carbon offset markets by two orders of magnitude from \$3 million in 2010 to \$326 million in 2019. However, public programs connected to PFES have steadily decreased in real dollar terms over time, as has participating land area. Various states and regions in the U.S. have higher or lower level of PFES connected to different service categories, for various apparent reasons. Results suggest that some small, highly-urban states received high levels of payments for conservation easements. Other states with a large agricultural land base relative to forestry received relatively high levels of public conservation program payments. Some states with both large private forest area and large urban centers had high values of payments for recreational access, such as hunting and wildlife viewing.},

We assess the effectiveness and return on investment of two different schemes designed to encourage biodiversity conservation in Switzerland: payments for actions and payments for results. Empirically, we exploit a major policy reform that created a natural experiment by abruptly and unevenly increasing both payments across farmers. Using difference in differences, we estimate the effect of the policy reform on farmers for whom only the action- or the results-based payments increased, as well as on those for whom both increased, compared to farmers for whom neither increased. Our findings are fourfold: First, higher payments increased the biodiversity conservation area. A payment raise by 1\% increased conservation areas on average by 0.6\% in the action based, and by 1\% in the results-based scheme. Second, the combination of both schemes increased average effectiveness but also windfall gains. Third, using a benefit transfer approach, we estimate a positive return of investment for all payment increases. Finally, the estimated return on investment for the results-based payments is higher than for the action-based payments.},

Considerable heterogeneity exists in the average treatment effect of retaliation. First, retaliatory trade actions presented a strong within-year seasonal impact. Nearly 70\% of aggregate trade losses occurred during the US's peak export marketing season. Second, U.S. trade losses were particularly pronounced on homogeneous bulk commodities, whereas product differentiation dampened the impact of retaliation. Third, with few exceptions, the counterfactually estimated direct trade losses line up well with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) trade damage estimates for trade aid programs distributed to farmers impacted by the trade dispute. Finally, we find little evidence that U.S. exports were able to be reoriented to alternative, nonretaliating markets—an indication of high bilateral trade frictions and the destructive consequences of retaliatory trade actions.},

Evacuation is a key protective action against hurricane danger, but it may be costly for individuals. Despite being an important input to emergency management decisions, there is little evidence on the size of these costs. In this paper we estimate the welfare costs of hurricane evacuations. We combine spatial data on hurricanes, flooding, and evacuation orders with millions of records of individuals’ cell phone-derived movement activity to study how communities behave during hurricanes. These data generate rich insights about evacuation behavior, including differences by physical risk, information provision, and demographics. Using a structural travel cost model we estimate that the welfare costs of evacuation can be large when compared to mortality costs, averaging a ratio of one to ten but occasionally exceeding the value of statistical life lost (VSL). These results document an understudied cost of hurricanes.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, agriculture is recognized as valuable not only for food production, but also for regulating and supporting ecosystem services such as those encompassing biodiversity and water. Various government programs provide incentives to farmers and ranchers to maintain ecosystem services, with an emerging focus on payment-for-ecosystem services (PES) programs. However, interactions among ecosystem services, including synergies or trade-offs, at spatial scales relevant to land managers are not well understood. Here, we examined how a PES program for enhanced water retention on subtropical ranchlands in the headwaters of the Everglades affected seven indicators of ecosystem services and three indicators of disservices within wetlands (local scale) and among wetlands (wetland scale) at four different ranches. We used general linear mixed models and model selection to evaluate the feasibility of explicit, a priori hypotheses using data from 15 wetlands sampled across four participating ranches. Our study indicated that managing for increased water retention could result in both synergies and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Higher water retention increased wetland plants at both local and wetland scales and was associated with reduced mosquitoes. Trade-offs included signiﬁcant declines in forage plant cover and decreases in amphibian abundance with higher water retention. Unimodal non-linear relationships described responses of macroinvertebrates, ﬁsh, mosquito, and non-native plant abundance to increasing water retention. These complex relationships indicate that optimizing water retention, provisioning services, and wetland biodiversity in ranchlands may not be straightforward. Unimodal non-linear relationships among water retention and biodiversity suggest there is a threshold of water retention that represents a trade-off for also maintaining biodiversity. Land use was an important driver of ecosystem disservices, with more intensely managed ranches having a greater potential for ecosystem disservices such as increased cover of non-native plants, abundant mosquitoes, and lower amphibian abundance. Multidisciplinary collaboration was required to design, implement, monitor, and assess this PES program for trade-offs and synergies.},

The elasticities of exports to US-Chinese tariffs identify whether a country's exports complement or substitute the United States or China and its supply curve's slope. Countries that operate along downward-sloping supplies whose exports substitute (complement) the United States and China are among the larger (smaller) beneficiaries of the trade war.},

We use our experience with this program to identify key challenges to PES program design, including identifying a buyer and defining the environmental services; agreeing upon credible, yet practical, approaches to quantifying the services provided; reducing programmatic costs in light of existing policies and complex regulatory issues; and maintaining an adaptive approach to program design and implementation, while satisfying the concerns of multiple stakeholders.},

Its evolution has been heavily influenced by several developments in the international trade literature. The first relates to trade theories that connect closely with observables: new Ricardian models and firm-level analysis. The second relates to a shift toward applied work involving estimated gravity models and counterfactual simulations. Within a unifying framework, we provide a bird-eye overview of recent developments in trade literature that improves the predictive capability of empirical and theoretical studies for agricultural and food sectors. We highlight how land heterogeneity, technology, vertical relationships in the food chain, quality of food products, and taste affect agri-food trade and its welfare consequences. We also discuss the emergence of new policy issues such as climate change, quality standards, food security, market volatility, and nutrition transition, where although trade may not be at the center of the issues it mediates most of the effects. Last, this chapter identifies possible future developments to make agricultural trade a very active research field, with specific focus on the consumer preferences, hidden costs, production technologies, and market structures.},

Given the increasing scale and complexity of trade, understanding the inherent dynamics and potential vulnerabilities of FTN becomes an urgent concern. Here, this study employed complex network method to investigate the structure, dynamics, and vulnerabilities of the trade networks associated with four main food crops (rice, maize, wheat, and soybeans) over the period 2000 to 2019. Our results show that the FTN has features consistent with both scale-free and small-world networks. A small percentage of 10\% of major food producing countries trade with a significant proportion of 80\% of all countries within the network. In the examined period, FTN has experienced remarkable changes, emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil and Russia have become more important, offsetting the historical dominance of nations such as the United States, Canada and Australia. In addition, many countries become increasingly reliant on food imports, the number of their trading partners within the FTN is decreasing, highlights potential increasing vulnerabilities. Simulation analysis also show that disruptions affecting about 5\% of nations could seriously destabilize the FTN, which would be a cautionary tale for the stability of future food systems. This research provides policymakers with a fundamental perspective on mitigating potential risks in global FTN.},

We then present new survey evidence of signiﬁcant gaps at the individual level between Republicans and Democrats in self-reported social distancing, beliefs about personal COVID risk, and beliefs about the future severity of the pandemic.},

By recognizing that PES programs are incentive-based, policymakers can draw on insights from the substantial body of accumulated knowledge about this class of instruments. In particular, this article offers a set of lessons about how the environmental, socioeconomic, political, and dynamic context of a PES policy is likely to interact with policy design to produce policy outcomes, including environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and poverty alleviation.},

The pattern of land use is often determined by the decisions of multiple private landowners. Increasing the provision of ecosystem services, though beneficial for society as a whole, may be costly to private landowners. A regulator interested in providing incentives to landowners for increased provision of ecosystem services often lacks complete information on landowners' costs. The combination of spatially dependent benefits and asymmetric cost information means that the optimal provision of ecosystem services cannot be achieved using standard regulatory or payment for ecosystem services approaches. Here we show that an auction that sets payments between landowners and the regulator for the increased value of ecosystem services with conservation provides incentives for landowners to truthfully reveal cost information, and allows the regulator to implement the optimal provision of ecosystem services, even in the case with spatially dependent benefits and asymmetric information.},

However, our understanding of causal relationships between evacuation orders and evacuation decision-making is still limited, in large part due to the lack of standardized, high-temporal-resolution data on historical evacuation orders. To overcome this gap, we developed the Hurricane Evacuation Order Database (HEvOD) – a comprehensive database of hurricane evacuation orders issued in the United States between 2014 and 2022. The database features evacuation orders that were systematically retrieved and compiled from a wide range of resources and includes information on order type, announcement time, effective time, and evacuation area. The rich collection of attributes and the resolution of the data in the database will allow researchers to systematically investigate the impact of evacuation orders, as a vital public policy instrument, and can serve as an important resource to identify gaps in current policies, leading to more effective policy design in response to hurricanes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, research has increasingly focused on the economic value of freshwater ecosystems, which provide essential services such as water supply, climate regulation, and recreation, but are highly vulnerable to human-induced degradation. To examine this body of work, a meta-analysis was conducted on 116 studies regarding the economic value of ecosystem services provided by freshwater ecosystems, which collectively reported 368 valuations. The results indicate that 50.2\% of the variation in existing value estimates can be explained by an econometric model that controls for (a) the geographical and socio-economic characteristics of the study site, (b) the valuation method and beneficiary type, and (c) the physical and ecological attributes of the specific biome and ecosystem service. The work illustrates the effect of different freshwater ecosystems on economic valuation estimates, also showing the impact of site and socio-economic characteristics of the study. Furthermore, the study assesses the prospects for using the meta-analytic value function derived from the model, finding an average transfer error of 14.4\%. This study effectively summarizes the existing literature on the economic value of freshwater ecosystems, allows for the establishment of stylized facts and provides the foundation for the development of tools to support environmental policy decisions.},

In this paper we provide summary values for 23 ecosystem services from 15 biomes to represent the magnitude, vari­ ation and gaps in economic values. To enable the comparison and synthesis of values, estimates in the ESVD are standardised to a common set of units (Int\$/ha/year at 2020 price levels).

Other farmers may fear losing the non-pecuniary beneﬁts derived from ‘working the land’. We conclude that economic incentives alone are unlikely to encourage certain cohorts of farmers to consider alternative land uses such as farm forestry and that policy ought to be guided by a better understanding of the differing farming motivations of farm operators.},

Ecosystem service valuation is being developed as a vehicle to integrate ecological understanding and economic considerations to redress the traditional neglect of ecosystem services in policy decisions. This paper presents a critical review on the neoclassical economic framework, tools used for economic valuation of ecosystem services and the economic welfare approach to collective decision-making, from an ecological perspective. The applicability of the framework and techniques for valuing ecosystem services are evaluated in light of the challenges posed by the complex, non-linear nature of many ecosystem services. Decisions concerning ecosystem management are often complex, socially contentious and fraught with uncertainty. Although judicious application of economic valuation techniques to ecosystem services can provide valuable information for conceptualizing decision choices and evaluating management options, there are serious limitations in the economic welfare approach to decision-making. These shortcomings and their implications for ecosystem management are elucidated and alternative approaches that emphasize participation, explicit treatment of uncertainty and transparent decision-making processes are discussed.},

The tenure reform of privatization replaced public ownership gradually and led to a significant 5.4\% increase in grassland quality on average. The grassland quality increase is twice as large for private grassland with additional access to public grassland compared to those without such access. Interestingly, public grassland quality did not decline, indicating sustainable utilization by herders. These findings are consistent with the literature which suggests that a properly structured hybrid ownership arrangement could benefit from the positive effects of grassland privatization while mitigating the negative impacts of natural disasters. We further provide empirical support and show that the gains from public grassland access are substantially larger when there are adverse climatic shocks. Our study provides important policy implications for property rights and sustainable grassland management under more frequent climate events.},

	abstract = {The economic effects of agricultural R \& D have generated a plethora of literature. Some of which has obtained the level of holy writ in agricultural economics. According to this write, public investment in agricultural research has increased productivity of output in general. While some may disagree, the literature suggests that farmers may be made better off from agricultural research. The social returns to agricultural research have been high ranging from a maximum of 79 - 96 percent on rice in Columbia to 21 - 25 percent on hybrid corn in the United States [1]. Some argue that these rates may even be understated due to the effects of yield maintenance. These rates of return far exceed any reasonable rate of return observed by stock market aggregates such as the Standard and Poors 500 and, if accurate, justify significant public investment in agricultural research at both the federal and state level in the United States. However, most of the gains to agricultural research accrue to households in the form of lower food prices, so productivity growth has a distributional effect - primarily benefiting lower and income households.},

It also spurs entrepreneurship among professional and large farmers and attracts more urban residents to start new businesses in rural areas. Additional analysis provides evidence that increased land and labor availability and productivity, and improved social trust may serve as the mechanisms underlying these effects. Altogether, these results reveal that well-defined land property rights have enabled more enterprise growth in rural areas.},

Empirical evidence is based on fixed effects regressions using large panel data sets on water supply companies and groundwater sampling sites in Germany. Local nitrate pollution at the abstraction plant is approximated using spatial interpolation. Our findings reveal that water suppliers incur substantial costs through groundwater nitrate pollution in terms of increased treatment and total costs. The estimated cost elasticities range from 0.048 to 0.052 for treatment costs and up to 0.019 for total costs. For an average firm, these estimates imply annual increases in treatment and total costs of €39,000 and €116,000, respectively, for a 10 milligrams per liter increase in groundwater nitrate concentrations.},

This paper assesses the potential of multiple cropping to offset the projected negative effects of climate change on agricultural yields in the United States. We use cross-sectional variation in observed land cover, soil characteristics, and climate to estimate farmers’ propensity to double-crop winter wheat with soybeans. Our estimates imply that under current economic conditions, a 3 C warming would result in an increase of 2.1 percentage points in the share of current soybean area double cropped, primarily driven by expansions in cooler regions. A fixed-effects panel model of county yields further indicates that yields of double-cropped soybeans are about 12\% lower than those of single-cropped soybeans. Accounting for changes in cropping intensity and attendant effects on soybean yields, we project that at current prices, a 3 C warming would induce a shift in cropping intensity that increases revenue from soy systems by 1.3\% overall, offsetting only a small fraction of the revenue impacts of predicted yield declines.},

Using county-level data from 2006 to 2019, our difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities estimates suggest that the program increased GDP per capita in the 14 areas by over 45\% from 2012 to 2019, with substantial gains observed in both the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. Our preferred estimates suggest that the rate of return to the program ranged from 155.8\% to 165.8\%. Using data from over 14,500 rural households from 2006 to 2015, we find that the program significantly elevated rural income and reduced rural poverty. Although the income growth of extremely poor households was driven more by agricultural income growth, the income growth of relatively poor households primarily resulted from nonagricultural sources.},

	abstract = {Purpose  The olive oil sector in Italy has a significant socio-economic, environmental, and cultural relevance. However, the environmental impacts of production and consumption models are considerable, mainly due to the demand for large quantities of resources (fuels, chemicals) and to the environmental impacts of residues’ disposal. Due to the scarcity of resources and climate change concerns, circular economy principles based on industrial ecology concepts are emerging. In this paper, the principles of circular economy were specifically applied to the olive oil supply chain, to improve the environmental sustainability of the sector.
Methods  The production chain of extra virgin olive oil was analyzed using the Life Cycle Assessment method, based on primary data from an oil farm and mill in Southern Italy. The environmental impacts were evaluated through the SimaPro software and the ReCiPe 2016 Mid-point (H) Impact Assessment Method, with reference to the functional unit of 1-L bottle of extra virgin olive oil. Some circular improvement options were investigated, comparing the impacts generated by (i) extra virgin olive oil linear production without valorization of by-products, (ii) extra virgin olive oil linear production with allocation of total impacts to co-products, and (iii) two circular production systems, incorporating improvements such as replacement of diesel with biodiesel and of electricity from the national grid with energy recovered from residues.
Results and discussion  The environmental impacts of the business-as-usual production pattern were identified for possible improvements. In all phases of the production chain of organic extra virgin olive oil, the most affected impact categories were human carcinogenic toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. As expected, the major contributions to almost all the analyzed impact categories were determined by the agricultural phase (92.65\%), followed by the bottling phase (7.13\%) and the oil extraction phase (0.22\%). The valorization of by-products was considered by widening the system boundaries to ensure the environmental sustainability by developing circular patterns that feedback waste materials to upstream steps of the same process. The environmental impacts resulted lower in almost all the impact categories, with the major benefits gained in the global warming and fossil depletion impact categories.
Conclusions  The analysis proved that the reuse of pomace, prunings, and exhausted cooking oil initially considered as waste can bring benefits from an environmental point of view to the larger scale of the economy, by replacing fossil fuels, as well as to the olive oil chain itself, by providing the needed energy for production.},

Furthermore, an analysis of the assessment of biogenic carbon has been carried out among the reviewed papers. As a result, 23 relevant LCA studies on olive oil production or olives cultivation (for olive oil production) were identified. Analysis of the literature converged on an unequivocal environmental hotspot, the agricultural phase; which represents the most impactful phase of the olive oil life cycle, due in particular to fertilisation, pesticides treatment, and irrigation. Waste management and distribution also appear to represent a crucial issue. The comparison work made on climate change impact assessment is on the order of magnitude of 460 kg CO2-eq/ton of olive and 1.6 kg CO2-eq/L of olive oil. This study highlights the complexity of carrying out an LCA on the olive oil sector. At last, best practices and methodological recommendations were matured.},

This study analyses the life cycle impact of three packaging solutions for high-quality extra-virgin olive oil. Two of them are widely used solutions, namely tin plated cans and dimmed glass bottles. The third one is a stainless steel bottle, which has been proposed recently. The analysis was performed with a cradle to grave approach and it takes into account raw materials extraction and processing, packaging production processes and several end-of-life scenarios. Impacts due to distribution were considered separately to assess uncertainties due to distribution distances. The results show that, for same sizes, dimmed glass bottles have the lowest overall impact value for all the six indicators selected except for ozone layer depletion, whereas stainless steel bottles have the highest impact values for all the other indicators. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how impact varies in function of distance and packaging weight. It shows that it is possible to set a breakeven point over which the impact of glass overcomes the one of the other packaging systems. Packaging shows a significant contribution to impact of bottled oil. For small packaging, such as a 0.100 L stainless steel bottle, this contribution can be as relevant as 60\% of the overall global warming potential.},

	abstract = {Wet olive pomace is an organic lignocellulosic material, a by-product of the olive milling process, a typical and traditional activity in many Mediterranean countries. Wet olive pomace has difficult commercialization due to its high moisture content of 55–65\%, that causes a noticeable increase in oil extraction costs. However, it could be conveniently reused in agriculture as a valid soil amendment to improve soil fertility and structure. Here, we studied the effects of the application of increasing amounts of non-fermented wet pomace on the fertility of a silty-clay soil, grown with 3 crops in succession: sunflower-wheat-wheat. The experiments were conducted at the Agricultural Faculty of Bari, Italy, on a Pachic Hoploxeroll soil characterized by illite and kaolinite and large amounts of Fe and Al sesquioxides. We compared the effect of wet pomace applied at amounts ranging from 0 to 210 Mg ha−1, incorporated 60 days prior to sunflower sowing. In the wheat late season of the second year, average samples from the 0–0.60 m layer were taken and tested for structural stability, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, pH and saturation extract electrical conductivity. The results indicate that the application of wet pomace induces a general improvement in soil fertility. In particular, the incorporation of increasing amounts of wet pomace improved nutrient content. For instance, an application of 210 Mg ha−1 of wet pomace increased soil organic matter by +84\%, total N by +0.90 g kg−1, available P by +79.40 mg kg−1 and exchangeable K by +80 mg kg−1. We also observed an improvement in soil structure, which is of particular importance in hot, arid environments and in sustainable agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {The production of olive oil is considered to be one of the largest agricultural business sectors in the Mediterranean area. Apart from its significant impact on the economies of countries in Southern Europe, Northern Africa and Middle East, olive oil production also involves considerable social and environmental considerations. However, despite such importance, the environmental effects of olive oil production have not been studied as much other agricultural productions and farming systems, which are more characteristic of central and northern Europe. We present a thorough and systematic literature review of scientific publications with respect to the use of environmental tools in the life cycle of olive oil. The analysis takes into consideration the farming of olive trees, the manufacture of olive oil, packaging, transportation and reverse logistics. To that end, journal publications up to 2015 in this specific field are recorded and, at the same time, the most important environmental impacts are revealed and a gap analysis is carried out. The analysis conducted reveals that farming of olive trees (with pesticide use and waste/by-product production being the ‘hottest’ topics) and the manufacturing of olive oil (concentrating mostly on waste/by-product production and management) are the phases with the highest environmental focus from the scientific community. Moreover, gaps in the literature are detected mostly with respect to fuel consumption and the use and promotion of renewable energy sources in olive oil production. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {The environmental impacts of global food supply chains are growing with the need for their measurement and management. This paper explores the operations of a global supply chain for extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) according to a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The LCA assessment methodology is applied to determine the environmental impact categories associated with the bottled EVOO life cycle, focusing on packaging decisions. The proposed analysis identifies the greatest environmental stressors of the EVOO supply chain, thereby supporting strategic and operative decisions toward more efficient and environmentally-friendly operations management and packaging choices. This paper quantifies the environmental categories of the impacts of global warming potential, ozone layer depletion, non-renewable energy use, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical smog, for the observed EVOO supply chain, given alternative packaging configurations, i.e., a glass bottle vs. a plastic bottle. The observed system includes the supply of EVOO, the EVOO processing and bottling, the supply of packaging, the distribution of final products to customers, the end-of-life (EOL) treatments regarding the management, recycling and the disposal of waste across a global supply chain. The findings from the LCA highlight the potential of PET bottles in reducing the environmental impact of EVOO supply chains and identifies hotspots of discussion for policy-makers, EVOO producers and consumers.},

However, environmental, economic and social problems over the past years have forced companies to apply marketing strategies, develop product diversiﬁcation, create new products and introduce them in new “green markets”. Launching Cantabrian canned anchovies into more sustainable markets requires measuring the environmental performance using Product Category Rules (PCRs) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). EPDs and PCRS include the environmental proﬁle of a range of similar products, such as all of the available canned anchovy products. The great variety of anchovy canned products depends on three process variables: the origin of the anchovy (Cantabria, Argentina and Chile or Peru), the type of oil (reﬁned olive oil, extra virgin olive oil and sunﬂower oil) and the packaging (aluminum, tinplate, glass and plastic).},

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the environmental impacts of canned sardines in olive oil, by considering fishing, processing, and packaging, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The case study concerns a product of a canning factory based in Portugal and packed in aluminum cans. It is the first LCA of a processed seafood product made with the traditional canning method. The production of both cans and olive oil are the most important process in the considered impact categories. The production of olives contributes to the high environmental load of olive oil, related to cultivation and harvesting phases. The production of aluminum cans is the most significant process for all impact categories, except ozone depletion potential and eutrophication potential, resulting from the high energy demand and the extraction of raw materials. To compare to other sardine products consumed in Portugal, such as frozen and fresh sardines, transport to the wholesaler and store was added. The environmental cost of canned sardines is almost seven times higher per kilogram of edible product. The main action to optimize the environmental performance of canned sardines is therefore to replace the packaging and diminish the olive oil losses as much as possible. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by half when plastic packaging is considered rather than aluminum. Frozen and fresh sardines represent much lower environmental impacts than canned sardines. Nevertheless, when other sardine products are not possible, it becomes feasible to use sardines for human consumption, preventing them from being wasted or used suboptimally as feed.},

However, the factors introducing variation into niche modeling outcomes are not well understood: To this end, we used seven algorithms to develop models (Maxent, GARP, BIOCLIM, artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, climate envelope, and environmental distance) to estimate the potential geographic distribution of olives (Olea europaea sensu lato, including Olea ferruginea) under two climatic data sets (current 2000 and future 2050). Five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios were used as predictor variables in future projections of the geographic potential of this species; models were fit at global extents (10′ spatial resolution) but transferred and interpreted for a region of particular interest in Central Asia, which largely avoids problems with truncation of niche estimates. We found marked differences among approaches in predicted distributions and model performance, as well as in the future distributional pattern reconstructed, from one algorithm to another. These general approaches, when model-to-model variation is managed appropriately, appear promising in predicting the potential geographic distribution of O. europaea sensu lato and thus can be an effective tool in restoration and conservation planning for wild populations, as well as possible commercial plantations of this species.},

	abstract = {Since 1995, more than 150,000 students and researchers have turned to The Craft of Research for clear and helpful guidance on how to conduct research and report it effectively . Now, master teachers Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams present a completely revised and updated version of their classic handbook.  Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects the way researchers actually work: in a complex circuit of thinking, writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this process influences the others and how a successful research report is an orchestrated conversation between a researcher and a reader. Along with many other topics, The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful yet critical readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, "So what?"  Celebrated by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability.  Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions are made among reasons, evidence, and reports of evidence. The concepts of qualifications and rebuttals are recast as acknowledgment and response. Part 4 covers drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography that includes many electronic sources.  The new edition retains the accessibility, insights, and directness that have made The Craft of Research an indispensable guide for anyone doing research, from students in high school through advanced graduate study to businesspeople and government employees. The authors demonstrate convincingly that researching and reporting skills can be learned and used by all who undertake research projects.

We examine how the degree of ecologisation affects farms' total factor productivity (TFP). Our analysis combines a random-parameter stochastic production frontier model with a composite indicator and a dose–response function approach. Results show a monotonically decreasing relationship between ecologisation and expected TFP level. On average, a one-step increase in the degree of ecologisation results in a 12\% decrease in TFP. However, the results indicate a non-linear relationship. Three regions of the dose–response function can be distinguished; associated with high, medium and low degrees of ecologisation. In a region with a low degree of ecologisation, farms can increase the degree of ecologisation without reducing TFP. Both efficiency and technological differences contribute to these differences, but the main reason is technological. With increasing ecologisation, farm technology becomes more ‘land using’. Therefore, farms can increase their TFP and degree of ecologisation simultaneously by using land-saving technologies or through sustainable intensification.},

Our two main objectives are: first, to identify and discuss a range of possible motives for protest responses that emerge in a WTA context; second, we analyse the impact on WTA estimates of censoring serial non-participation linked to protest or high compensation requirements (very high takers). Using a random parameter logit model in WTA space, we find that the inclusion or exclusion of serial non-participants in the analysis can have a significant impact on marginal and total WTA estimates. Based on the findings, the paper makes recommendations on how to reduce the incidence of protest responses through survey design, regarding the identification of protesters as opposed to very high takers, and regarding the treatment of both groups of respondents for WTA estimation.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of psychological factors on building the consumer’s behavioral decision process towards extra virgin olive oil, with special attention paid to the organic attribute. The paper hypothesises that differences in consumers’ personality traits, such as food-related personality traits, purchasing habits and lifestyles, affect consumers’ preferences for extra virgin olive oil. The methodological framework is based on the specification of an extended hybrid choice model (HCM), which was estimated following a two-step procedure. In the first step, a structural equation model was estimated to test for hierarchical relationships between latent variables to explain purchasing intentions towards an organic olive oil. In the second step, the predicted latent variables were introduced in a random parameter logit (RPL) model to investigate the main determinants of consumers’ choices related to extra virgin olive oil and the specific role of the organic attribute. The results from this study reinforce the need to include the psychological characteristics of consumers, such as attitudes, food-related personality traits, purchase habits and lifestyle orientation, to better explain how individuals make food choices and to better understand the decision maker’s process. Interestingly, Catalan consumers perceive a disutility from the organic attribute compared to other production system alternatives (conventional and PDO), while subjective norms and a higher perception of behavioral control only partially mitigate this effect. Environmental or health concerns seem to not be relevant to consumers’ choices related to olive oil as the conventional olive oil is already perceived as a healthy product per se.},

	abstract = {Although economic research on food consumer demand has exploded in recent years, most survey demand elicitation approaches have substantial limitations for food policy evaluations as they involve consumers choosing only one item out of a bundle. There is a need to design a more flexible approach capturing more realistic consumption patterns. This study introduces such an approach – a basket-based choice experiment –where consumers select their preferred food item or combination thereof. Our basket-based choice experiment includes 21 food items that can be freely combined to construct over 2 million possible baskets. Our results show that when given the opportunity, consumers select multiple items for their basket, most commonly three or four items. A composite conditional likelihood function approach is used to reduce the computational burden asso­ ciated with modeling the choice of over 2 million possible baskets, and estimates are utilized in a multivariate logit model to calculate the probability of bundle selection and individual food price elasticities. Unlike typical choice experiments utilizing multinomial logit model variants, which forces products to be demand substitutes, our basket-based approach is able to capture a rich set of substitution and complementary patterns, and we find that most of the 21 food items studied are demand complements. The BBCE is used to explore policy questions related to the impacts of changing prices on the healthfulness of consumer dietary choices and the welfare effects of product bans, such as Meatless Monday.},

The traditional and modern estimation methods for PLS-SEM are now readily facilitated by both open-source and commercial software packages.

This book presents PLS-SEM as a useful practical statistical toolbox that can be used for estimating many different types of research models. In so doing, the authors provide the necessary technical prerequisites and theoretical treatment of various aspects of PLS-SEM prior to practical applications. What makes the book unique is the fact that it thoroughly explains and extensively uses comprehensive Stata (plssem) and R (cSEM and plspm) packages for carrying out PLS-SEM analysis.

In this sense, the objective of this paper is to identify the preferences of olive oil consumers and propose a series of business strategies for the producing sector. The methodology consisted in a survey of 404 olive oil consumers during the months of January and February 2013, whose preferences were determined through several multivariate techniques (conjoint analysis, consumer segmentation and a simulation of market share). The preferred olive oil is low priced, extra virgin and organic. The type of bottle does not appear to be relevant in the buying decision process, although it might be a factor in increasing market share. The current economic crisis has resulted in the emergence of two consumer segments; 67.1\% of consumers selected the olive oil they buy on the basis of price and 32.9\% were guided by the product’s specific attributes, which include, for example, organic production, which can be another differentiating element for producing companies.},

	abstract = {This paper tries to shed light on a key question for different foodstuffs: why are product differentiation strategies far from successful in some agri-food markets? Undoubtedly, understanding consumer behaviour in situations where product differentiation failures occur is essential to resolving this issue. To that end, we built a theoretical model to analyse the roles played by both consumer information and inferences made from informational stimuli, given their potential relevance to the differentiation process. We thus examined consumer knowledge structures and brand credence related to attitudes toward a particular foodstuff and a product alternative, as well as the actual consumption of the foodstuff. The theoretical model was tested by an empirical application, using variance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) with the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm. Results showed that attitudes to both products explained the relative consumption of the foodstuff under study. In addition, product knowledge influenced consumers’ attitude towards the foodstuff and its consumption, but not the attitude towards the product alternative. On the contrary, the higher the brand equity of the product alternative, the better the attitude towards it. In addition, this factor was shown to have an impact on the attitude towards and consumption of the foodstuff. Therefore, those variables are key to explaining consumer behaviour in such agri-food markets, where increasing consumers’ knowledge and creating consumer-based brand equity seem to be appropriate strategies to improve the differentiation process.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of psychological factors on building the consumer’s behavioral decision process towards extra virgin olive oil, with special attention paid to the organic attribute. The paper hypothesises that differences in consumers’ personality traits, such as food-related personality traits, purchasing habits and lifestyles, affect consumers’ preferences for extra virgin olive oil. The methodological framework is based on the specification of an extended hybrid choice model (HCM), which was estimated following a two-step procedure. In the first step, a structural equation model was estimated to test for hierarchical relationships between latent variables to explain purchasing intentions towards an organic olive oil. In the second step, the predicted latent variables were introduced in a random parameter logit (RPL) model to investigate the main determinants of consumers’ choices related to extra virgin olive oil and the specific role of the organic attribute. The results from this study reinforce the need to include the psychological characteristics of consumers, such as attitudes, food-related personality traits, purchase habits and lifestyle orientation, to better explain how individuals make food choices and to better understand the decision maker’s process. Interestingly, Catalan consumers perceive a disutility from the organic attribute compared to other production system alternatives (conventional and PDO), while subjective norms and a higher perception of behavioral control only partially mitigate this effect. Environmental or health concerns seem to not be relevant to consumers’ choices related to olive oil as the conventional olive oil is already perceived as a healthy product per se.},

Olive oil is a prominent, sustainable, healthy, and distinctive product associated with the Mediterranean diet. Based on a survey conducted among a sample of 402 consumers, we apply the Best Worst Scaling method to measure the importance of some attributes that influence consumer preferences for olive oil. Our results show that consumers rate price, geographical origin, protected designation of origin label, and olive variety, as important product attributes. Conversely, attributes such as organic label certification, size, and packaging material are considered less important. As the perceived importance of olive oil attributes differs across individuals, we further estimate a five-class solution and describe each class in terms of knowledge and consumption of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Finally, we discuss the implications of studying consumer preferences for olive oil and provide managerial insights.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated approach that combines the two methods usually used in the real estate appraisals, namely, the income capitalisation method and the hedonic model. Design/methodology/approach In order to pull out the link between the income capitalisation approach and the hedonic model, the standard hedonic price function is introduced into the basic model of income capitalisation instead of the house market value. It follows that, from the partial derivative, a direct relation between hedonic prices and discount rate can be obtained. Finally, by using the close relationship between income capitalisation and direct capitalisation, a mathematical relation between hedonic prices and capitalisation rate is also obtained. Findings The developed method allows to estimate the capitalisation rate using only hedonic prices. Indeed, selling and hedonic prices incorporate all of the information required to correctly estimate the capitalisation rate. Furthermore, given the close relation among going-in and going-out capitalisation rates and discount rate, the proposed method could also be useful for determining both the going-out capitalisation rate and the discount rate. Practical implications Obviously, it is always preferable to estimate the capitalisation rate by just using comparable transactional data. Nevertheless, the method developed in this paper is especially useful when: the rental income data are missing and/or not entirely reliable; the data on rental income and house price are related to different homes; the capitalisation rate, in fact, should compare the rent and value of identical homes. In these cases, therefore, the method can be a valuable alternative to direct estimation. Originality/value The large and important literature on real estate economics and real estate appraisal neglects the relationship between hedonic prices and capitalisation rate, thus considering the hedonic model and the income capitalisation approach as two separate and alternative methods. This paper, instead, shows that integration is possible and relatively simple.},

To this aim, a discrete choice experiment was carried out that allowed us to identify the eﬀect of each of the attributes on the choices of the interviewees and to highlight the presence of heterogeneity in consumer preferences. The analysis carried out highlights the presence of a strong segmentation of the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) market in the Veneto region. In the estimated model, the heterogeneity of preferences is particularly relevant in the case of Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) production, handicraft milling, and organic production. In contrast, the interviewees’ preferences appear to be very homogeneous for the Italian or Veneto EVOO. The results of our research conﬁrm that the place of production is one of the most important clues considered by consumers when buying EVOO. This eﬀect, however, appears to be less important in the areas where olive tree cultivation occupies only a reduced fraction of the cultivated area. In these situations, people tend to prioritize the consumption of EVOO from other regions where production is more widespread. Olive growing that preserves the traditional landscape appears to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on consumer behavior, but only for some market segments.},

We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world’s demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards’ harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts. Findings improve market predictability and transparency, and ultimately support decision-making and strategic planning in the olive oil sector.},

Research limitations/implications– A limitation of this study is associated with the geographic area where it was carried out, that is, the city of Chillán in the Bío-Bío Region, which is the second largest region and accounts for 12 per cent of the total population. Further research should include other cities such as Santiago (capital), Concepción, Curicó and Valparaíso. Originality/value– This study can be considered as a first approximation of a hedonic pricing model estimation for olive oil in non-traditional markets like Chile, which is considered an emerging market.},

	abstract = {Olive oil has been consumed since ancient times and appreciated as a source of nutritious fats and as medical remedy, in addition to being praised in ceremonies. Today, when health is one of the top priorities of humankind, we examined what consumers believe and value about olive oil, which is generally considered a healthy product. Our survey examined the associations between the hedonic and health properties of olive oil, the motives important for olive oil consumption, and how these are inﬂuenced by healthy behaviour. There was clear evidence of the importance of culture, tradition, pleasure, olive oil health beneﬁts, and healthy behaviour. There was a strong association between healthy behaviour and olive oil beneﬁt perceptions and motives for olive oil consumption, with the olive oil beneﬁts associated with the motives to consume olive oil.},

Therefore, a survey was conducted in 2019 on a sample of 705 German and 175 UK consumers. In both samples, three consumer segments were identiﬁed. These three segments diﬀered signiﬁcantly with regard to purchase and consumption patterns, as well as attitudes toward the extrinsic, intrinsic, sensorial, and health attributes of olive oil. Their main preferences related to health properties of olive oil, followed by hedonic attributes; therefore, these aspects should be marketed in German markets. For UK consumers, validation of extrinsic attributes, such as region, micro-location, and protected designation of geographical origin (PDO), should be used in marketing campaigns in light of economic sustainability on local family farms and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Since UK consumers rely heavily on vendors’ recommendations, more eﬀort should be made in the UK market to establish habits of consumption and an olive oil culture that would be sustainable in long-term time frames.},

	abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is a variance-based structural equation modeling technique that is widely applied in business and social sciences. It is the method of choice if a structural equation model contains both factors and composites. This chapter aggregates new insights and offers a fresh look at PLS path modeling. It presents the newest developments, such as consistent PLS, confirmatory composite analysis, and the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT). PLS path modeling can be regarded as an instantiation of generalized canonical correlation analysis. It aims at modeling relationships between composites, i.e., linear combinations of observed variables. A recent extension, consistent PLS, makes it possible to also include factors in a PLS path model. The chapter illustrates how to specify a PLS path model consisting of construct measurement and structural relationships. It also shows how to integrate categorical variables. A particularly important consideration is model identification: Every construct measured by multiple indicators must be embedded into a nomological net, which means that there must be at least one other construct with which it is related. PLS path modeling results are useful for exploratory and confirmatory research. The chapter provides guidelines for assessing the fit of the overall model, the reliability and validity of the measurement model, and the relationships between constructs. Moreover, it provides a glimpse on various extensions of PLS, many of which will be described in more detail in later chapters of the book.},

Step-by-step instructions and guidelines using SmartPLS 3.0 are provided using a sample dataset. The instructions include an assessment of the measurement characteristics of the constructs by including the MICOM procedure, which adds an additional level of accuracy. Examples of both positive and negative outcomes as well as potential solutions to problems are provided in order to help users understand how to apply multigroup analysis to their own dataset. By using multigroup analysis, researchers are able to uncover differences of subsamples within the total population that is not evident when examined as a whole. Researchers having the ability to run multigroup analysis considerably improve the likelihood of identifying significant and meaningful differences in various relationships across group-specific results.},

Instead analysis proceeded more by analogical models than structural equation models. Such models had very limited usefulness for addressing significant policy issues. The development of partial least squares and its application in school survey research led not only to findings more relevant to policy issues of concern but also supported the development of the underlying theoretical models.},

Design/methodology/approach The authors employed an explorative cognitive mapping technique on a sample of key informants among Italian companies and a consortium of registered food, spirits and wine products. Findings This study describes the key concepts dominant in the discourse of informants concerning digitalization and its influence on the GI market. Three clusters and two loops were also identified to explain the relationship among key concepts, which stress changes regarding the relationship with the consumer, product experience and innovation, and the integration between physical and virtual space. Research limitations/implications This is the first attempt to apply cognitive maps to GIs. However, the study does have limitations: it was conducted on a small number of producers and was restricted to only Italy. Another limitation is that interviews were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications The results suggest important practical implications that stress the need for learning and increased digital competences for the efficient embedding of digital technologies in all business areas, increase product value and innovation, and the need for governance in support of digital transformation.

a chemical point of view, 98-99\% of the total weight of EVOO is represented by fatty acids, especially monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid. Tocopherols, polyphenols and other minor constituents represent the remaining 1-2\%. All these components may potentially contribute to ”health
maintenance” with their beneficial effects by EVOOO. Methods: Studies that examined the effect of EVOO supplementation in healthy subjects and in individuals at cardiovascular risk were included. Conclusion: The studies analyzed demonstrated the role of EVOO as anti-inflammatory,

	abstract = {This paper reports the comparison of determination methods for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) adulteration with two kinds of oils, refined olive oil (ROO) and soybean oil by 19FNMR, 1H NMR and chemical titration. The determination of adulteration of EVOO with ROO by 19F NMR was comparable to the conventional method. The contents of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids of different oil samples can be determined by both 1H NMR and GC-MS. The results obtained from the two methods showed little differences. The adulteration of EVOO with soybean oil is detected by 1H NMR, although the limit of detection of the adulteration level is not less than 4.5\%. The research demonstrates that 19F NMR can be a fast and convenient method to detect EVOO if it is adulterated with ROO and 1H NMR can be a fast and convenient method to detect EVOO if it is adulterated with seed oils.},

However, a large proportion of the population consumes olive oil after a depurative process that not only mellows its taste, but also deprives it of polyphenols and other minority components. In this study, we compare the influence on the intestinal microbiota of a diet high in this refined olive oil (ROO) with other fat-enriched diets. Swiss Webster mice were fed standard or a high-fat diet enriched with EVOO, ROO, or butter (BT). Physiological parameters were also evaluated. At the end of the feeding period, DNA was extracted from feces and the 16S rRNA was pyrosequenced. The group fed ROO behaved differently to the EVOO group in half the families with statistically significant differences among the diets, with higher comparative levels in three families—Desulfovibrionaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Helicobacteraceae—correlating with total cholesterol. These results are again indicative of a link between specific diets, certain physiological parameters and the prevalence of some taxa, but also support the possibility that polyphenols and minor components of EVOO are involved in some of the proposed effects of this fat through the modulation of the intestinal microbiota},

Previous findings in AD mouse models have reported the beneficial effect of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) against AD, which improved BBB and memory functions and reduced brain amyloid-β (Aβ) and related pathology. This work aimed to translate these preclinical findings to humans in individuals with MCI. We examined the effect of daily consumption of refined olive oil (ROO) and EVOO for 6 months in MCI subjects on BBB permeability (assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI), and brain function (assessed using functional-MRI) as the primary outcomes. Cognitive function and AD blood biomarkers were also assessed as the secondary outcomes. Twenty-six participants with MCI were randomized with 25 participants completed the study. EVOO significantly improved clinical dementia rating (CDR) and behavioral scores. EVOO also reduced BBB permeability and enhanced functional connectivity. While ROO consumption did not alter BBB permeability or brain connectivity, it improved CDR scores and increased functional brain activation to a memory task in cortical regions involved in perception and cognition. Moreover, EVOO and ROO significantly reduced blood Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau/t-tau ratios, suggesting that both altered the processing and clearance of Aβ. In conclusion, EVOO and ROO improved CDR and behavioral scores; only EVOO enhanced brain connectivity and reduced BBB permeability, suggesting EVOO biophenols contributed to such an effect. This proof-of-concept study justifies further clinical trials to assess olive oil’s protective effects against AD and its potential role in preventing MCI conversion to AD and related dementias.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services provide an instinctive way to understand the trade-offs associated with natural resource management. However, despite their apparent usefulness, several hurdles have prevented ecosystem services from becoming deeply embedded in environmental decision-making. Ecosystem service studies vary widely in focal services, geographic extent, and in methods for defining and measuring services. Dissent among scientists on basic terminology and approaches to evaluating ecosystem services create difficulties for those trying to incorporate ecosystem services into decision-making. To facilitate clearer comparison among recent studies, we provide a synthesis of common terminology and explain a rationale and framework for distinguishing among the components of ecosystem service delivery, including: an ecosystem's capacity to produce services; ecological pressures that interfere with an ecosystem's ability to provide the service; societal demand for the service; and flow of the service to people. We discuss how interpretation and measurement of these four components can differ among provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. Our flexible framework treats service capacity, ecological pressure, demand, and flow as separate but interactive entities to improve our ability to evaluate the sustainability of service provision and to help guide management decisions. We consider ecosystem service provision to be sustainable when demand is met without decreasing capacity for future provision of that service or causing undesirable declines in other services. When ecosystem service demand exceeds ecosystem capacity to provide services, society can choose to enhance natural capacity, decrease demand and/or ecological pressure, or invest in a technological substitute. Because regulating services are frequently overlooked in environmental assessments, we provide a more detailed examination of regulating services and propose a novel method for quantifying the flow of regulating services based on estimates of ecological work. We anticipate that our synthesis and framework will reduce inconsistency and facilitate coherence across analyses of ecosystem services, thereby increasing their utility in environmental decision-making.},

An analytical framework for ecosystem assessments under action 5 of the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 : discussion paper – final, April 2013
Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 calls Member States to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services in their national territory with the assistance of the European Commission. The objective of this discussion paper is to support the development of a coherent analytical framework to be applied by the EU and its Member States in order to ensure consistent approaches are used. In line with the Millennium Ecosystem assessment, the objective of the EU assessment is to provide a critical evaluation of the best available information for guiding decisions on complex public issues. It is therefore framed by a broad set of key policy questions. It is structured around a conceptual framework that links human societies and their well-being with the environment. More specifically, the paper proposes a typology of ecosystems to be assessed and mapped and the use of the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) developed for environmental accounting purposes

This nevertheless is a key issue, in particular, if ecosystem services analysis and valuation is used to support environmental management. This study assesses and analyzes how the monetary benefits of seven ecosystem services are generated in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, are distributed to different types of beneficiaries. We analyze the following ecosystem services: (1) timber production; (2) rattan collection; (3) jelutong resin collection; (4) rubber production (based on permanent agroforestry systems); (5) oil palm production on three management scales (company, plasma farmer, and independent smallholder); (6) paddy production; and (7) carbon sequestration. Our study shows that the benefits generated from these services differ markedly between the stakeholders, which we grouped into private, public, and household entities. The distribution of these benefits is strongly influenced by government policies and in particular benefit sharing mechanisms. Hence, land-use change and policies influencing land-use change can be expected to have different impacts on different stakeholders. Our study also shows that the benefits generated by oil palm conversion, a main driver for land-use change in the province, are almost exclusively accrued by companies and at this point in time are shared unequally with local stakeholders.},

Spatial models for ecosystem services try to capture spatial heterogeneity with high accuracy. This endeavour, however, faces several practical constraints. In this article we analyse the trade-offs between accurately representing spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services and the practical constraints of modelling ecosystem services. By doing so we aim to explore the boundary conditions for best practice of spatial ecosystem accounting. We distinguished seven types of spatial ES modelling methods, including four types of look-up tables, causal relationships, spatial interpolation, and environmental regression. We classified 29 spatial ES models according to a judgement of accuracy and modelling feasibility. Best practice of spatial ES models varies depending on the reliability requirements of different policy applications and decision contexts. We propose that in best practice for ecosystem accounting an approach should be adopted that provides sufficient accuracy at acceptable costs given heterogeneity of the respective service. Furthermore, we suggest that different policy applications require different accuracy and different spatial modelling approaches. Societal investment in higher data availability of ecosystem services make models of a specific accuracy more feasible or would enable achievement of higher accuracy with comparable feasibility.},

This paper therefore aims to provide an overview of the challenges involved in applying ecosystem service assessment and valuation to environmental management and discuss some solutions to come to a comprehensive and practical framework. First the issue of defining and classifying ecosystem services is discussed followed by approaches to quantify and value ecosystem services. The main part of the paper is focussed on the question how to analyze trade-offs involved in land cover and land use change, including spatial analysis and dynamic modelling tools. Issues of scale are addressed, as well as the question how to determine the total economic value of different management states. Finally, developments and challenges regarding the inclusion of ecosystem services in integrative landscape planning and decision-making tools are discussed. It is concluded that the ecosystem service approach and ecosystem service valuation efforts have changed the terms of discussion on nature conservation, natural resource management, and other areas of public policy. It is now widely recognized that nature conservation and conservation management strategies do not necessarily pose a trade-off between the “environment” and “development”. Investments in conservation, restoration and sustainable ecosystem use are increasingly seen as a “win-win situation” which generates substantial ecological, social and economic benefits.},

We clarify the relevant valuation principles, most significantly the need to apply the concept of exchange values, and explain why the integration of ecosystem services necessitates an extension of the standard production boundary used in economic measurement. The main implications of an accounting approach are discussed including the need to distinguish benefits from services, the need for valuation methods that exclude consumer surplus, and the importance of aligning measures of income and degradation. Remaining challenges include the treatment of low or negative rents, accounting for ecosystem disservices, and the derivation of values for ecosystem assets. Meeting these challenges and advancing work in this area should be the joint focus of economists, ecologists and accountants.},

Our results suggest four strategies, speciﬁcally; ‘resource-based’, ‘network-based’, ‘policy-based’ and ‘market-based’, capable of valorising the resource from environmental, economic and societal points of view. The active management of chestnut forests, together with the development of a value chain can guarantee sustainable production, technological and process innovation and could empower companies to face global markets in a more competitive way and lead to the creation of high value-added products, generating a strong economic and social engine for the revival of the sector. Moreover, the commitment of the private sector to the reorganisation of the supply chain must also be accompanied by coherent public policy action. This is essential for the adoption of plans and programmes consistent with sustainable development objectives, ensuring their prioritisation and implementation.},

According to the MAP, transition means a gradual and constant process of reconversion of production activities that should be balanced with the economic and social dimension of the region. In this process, the territorial approach, encouraging the creation of partnerships, should be the basis of each action to achieve carbon neutrality. Promising themes in this process of transition are result-based approaches, carbon markets and environmental certification. This last subject was stressed by the MAP given the growing demand from business to showcase the outputs of sustainability strategies to consumers (e.g. in terms of reduced emissions and/or enhanced biodiversity). For all the themes discussed, the need for making progress in research was highlighted to enhance the effectiveness of the strategies to achieve carbon neutrality targets. In this regard, the link between policy and research should be strengthened and the next RDP could provide an example of evidence-based policy.},

	abstract = {It has been 20 years since two seminal publications about ecosystem services came out: an edited book by Gretchen Daily and an article in Nature by a group of ecologists and economists on the value of the world’s ecosystem services. Both of these have been very highly cited and kicked off an explosion of research, policy, and applications of the idea, including the establishment of this journal. This article traces the history leading up to these publications and the subsequent debates, research, institutions, policies, on-the-ground actions, and controversies they triggered. It also explores what we have learned during this period about the key issues: from deﬁnitions to classiﬁcation to valuation, from integrated modelling to public participation and communication, and the evolution of institutions and governance innovation. Finally, it provides recommendations for the future. In particular, it points to the weakness of the mainstream economic approaches to valuation, growth, and development. It concludes that the substantial contributions of ecosystem services to the sustainable wellbeing of humans and the rest of nature should be at the core of the fundamental change needed in economic theory and practice if we are to achieve a societal transformation to a sustainable and desirable future.},

A two-step cluster analysis was then applied to classify farms into representative types within the derived typology.

Our objective is to explore the social preferences for ecosystem services, and the associated willingness to pay, in three multifunctional agroecosystem in Europe (Mediterranean, Atlantic, Alpine) under alternative agrienvironmental policy scenarios. We use the same methodology (a choice experiment including equivalent attributes and levels) to rank and estimate the economic value of provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services. We deﬁne the scenarios (current situation, abandonment and enhanced management) in biophysical terms to elucidate changing relations between social perception and level of delivery of ecosystem services. We derive some lessons. i) Value of ES: biodiversity and regulating ecosystem services always produce welfare gains; people, however, perceive trade-oﬀs between delivery of agricultural landscapes and quality food products. Nevertheless, preferences are heterogeneous and vary across regions, scenarios and ES. ii) Policymaking: society’s willingness to pay for the delivery of ecosystem service exceeds largely the current level of public support. Moreover, further abandonment and intensiﬁcation of agriculture is clearly rejected by the public. iii) Methodological: monetary valuation is context dependent and extrapolation of economic values can be misleading.},

In the ﬁrst, rural areas are generally portrayed as less developed and in need of change. The second is related to the association of the rural with agricultural modernization. Finally, in the third, the countryside is increasingly understood as a repository of traditional cultural values and natural resources, in need of preservation. Despite the rise of hegemonic idyllic views on the rural in Portugal, following the tendency of the ‘global north’, there is a diversity of rural social representations, mainly related to historical and cultural speciﬁcities.},

This paper focuses on the case of rural tourism in illustrating the advantages of adopting a sustainable development approach to identifying suitable policies and strategic action plans to assist in addressing these increasingly complex challenges. The central proposition is that much can be achieved in raising the proﬁle of rural tourism and the nature of its interdependence with rural resources by re-conceptualising the rural resource as a kind of ‘capital asset’ of the rural tourism industry. Drawing on recent thinking by ecological economists, an approach based on the concept of the constant capital rule is set out. The paper then outlines some of the beneﬁts of re-casting the rural resource as ‘countryside capital’, using two case-study vignettes by way of illustration. A major conclusion is that re-conceptualising the rural resource as countryside capital provides a more holistic and integrated understanding of the rural tourism production system, which will be required if rural communities are to capture more effectively the potential beneﬁts rural tourism has to offer them. This, in turn, enables a much clearer articulation of the rationale for public-, private- and voluntary-sector investment in rural resources to be made.},

	abstract = {The effects of different grazing intensities on in situ methane flux and the structure and diversity of the methanotrophic community are measured in the typical grassland of Inner Mongolia. Four grazing intensity sites founded in 1989, control (CK), low-intensity grazing (LG), middle-intensity grazing (MG) and heavy-intensity grazing (HG), were selected. Group-specific PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) of 16S rRNA genes for the type I and type II methanotrophs was used to characterize the composition of the methanotrophic community. DGGE patterns were further analyzed using the method of the Shannon-wiener index H and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). The results showed that there were no significant differences in methane flux among different sites, yet methanotrophic communities showed significant differences. MDS analysis showed that type I methanotroph community composition at the CK site were significantly different from the three other sites. For type II methanotrophic community composition, it was similar between CK and HG site, and between LG and MG site, while that at the former two sites were significantly different from latter two ones. Additionally Shannon indices of type II methanotrophs were higher at the LG and MG sites than two other sites. Though grazing intensities had an impact on the structure of the methanotrophic community, management-induced changes in the structure of methanotrophic community did not reflect methane consumption capacity across sites. These results suggest that methane consumption is a complex process in soil, and we should be cautious when speculating on the change of methane consumption rates based on a change of methanotrophic community structure.},

The analysis of cropland utilization mainly focuses on change in the average amount of cropland per farm household, multiple cropping index (MCI), cropping structure, and degree of intensity. As for land productivity, the analysis mainly focuses on change in cropland productivity and agro-labor productivity. Compared with that 1930s, the average per household cropland areas at present has decreased to 30\%, but land productivity and agro-labor productivity have improved by two to three times and over three times respectively. This change is mainly due to the progress and extensive application of biochemistry technology. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the application of biochemical technology in the development of China’s agriculture, and emphasize on constructing infrastructures and basic conditions to implement such technology. Meanwhile, the law of diminishing marginal returns is also considered. In some regions where the marginal return of biochemical technology is already very low, the application of agricultural machinery should be further promoted through system innovation and scale operation.},

In this context, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of different resting/grazing periods on the composition, richness, diversity and dominance of functional groups of wetlands vegetation assemblages and (2) to analyze the influence of cattle exclusion on these parameters. For these purposes, three wetlands subjected to rotational grazing management included in different paddocks with different resting and grazing periods were selected. Exclosures were established in upland and lowland zones. Samples of vegetation cover were collected in these zones with quadrats of 4m2. Our results demonstrated that vegetation parameters did not differ as grazing and resting time period differed. Both the wetland with short resting/long grazing period as well as the wetland with long resting/short grazing period had lower diversity and richness in comparison with the wetland without cattle grazing. Grazing exclusion favoured the survival of species in upland zones, increasing total richness and diversity and the development of unpalatable non-forage and shrub/subshrub species. Exclosures would be beneficial to the ecological condition of the vegetation of the wetlands, allowing grazing-sensitive species to recover from grazing and trampling.},

In this paper, we identify the development and characteristics of mixed crop-livestock systems, with a focus on grassland-based systems, as these cover large areas in China, and face several challenges. Following the transition from the original hunting and foraging systems to a sedentary lifestyle with integrated crop-livestock production systems some 8000 years ago, a range of different mixed systems have developed, depending on rainfall, solar radiation and temperature, culture and markets. We describe 5 main types of integrated systems: (1) livestock and rangeland, (2) livestock and grain production, (3) livestock and crop – grassland rotations, (4) livestock, crops and forest (silvo-pasture), and (5) livestock, crops and ﬁsh ponds. Next, two of these mixed systems are described in greater detail, i.e., the mountain-oasisdesert system and its modiﬁcations in arid and semi-arid regions, and the integrated crop-livestock production systems on the Loess Plateau. In general, crop-livestock interactions in integrated systems have signiﬁcant positive effects on crop production, livestock production, energy use efﬁciency and economic proﬁtability. We conclude that improved integration of crop-livestock production systems is one of the most important ways for achieving a more sustainable development of animal agriculture in China.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes pose enormous threats to natural ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are key plant symbionts that can affect plant community dynamics and ecosystem stability. However, knowledge about how AM fungal communities respond to climate extremes in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Based on a grassland extreme drought experiment in Inner Mongolia, we investigated the response of AM fungal communities to extreme drought in association with plant communities. The experiment simulated two types of extreme drought (chronic/intense) of once-in-20-year occurrence. AM fungal richness and community composition exhibited high sensitivity to extreme drought and were more sensitive to intense drought than chronic drought. This community sensitivity (i.e. decline in richness and shifts in community composition) of AM fungi can be jointly explained by soil moisture, plant richness, and aboveground productivity. Notably, the robustness of the plant–AM fungal community co-response increased with drought intensity. Our results indicate that AM fungal communities are sensitive to climate extremes, and we propose that the plant community mediates AM fungal community responses. Given the ubiquitous nature of AM associations, their climate sensitivity may have profound consequences on plant communities and ecosystem stability under climate change.},

	abstract = {Quercus ecosystems have been affected globally by decline episodes, involving extreme defoliation and mortality events, during recent decades. Both abiotic and biotic factors seem to trigger these processes, including the spread of non-native invasive pathogens (e.g., Phytophthora spp.). However, we have limited understanding of how these factors interact in a spatio-temporal context. Regional forest health monitoring networks are a relevant but rarely used tool that enables us to disentangle the patterns of tree defoliation and mortality over time in relation to environmental and silvicultural drivers. In this study, we used a combination of statistical approaches (i.e., Kaplan-Meier, Kernel Density Estimation and generalized mixed models) to analyse 3635 records of oak trees (152 plots) from the Regional Forest Health Network of Andalusia (Spain) (2001–2016, ICP Level I). In this way, we studied the spatio-temporal variation of defoliation and mortality in dehesas of Quercus spp. in relation to oomycetes occurrence and the average and annual values of environmental factors related to oak decline. The annual defoliation and mortality were correlated with the mean annual temperature, Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI 18 summer and 1 spring) and soil organic matter content. The effect of oomycetes on forest decline was mediated by environmental factors, having greater importance in rich soils and wet years. These results imply that variation in defoliation and mortality is clearly linked to relevant spatio-temporal changes in environmental factors. Regional forest health networks are a crucial part of adaptive forest management strategies to significantly narrow the uncertainty regarding climate change impacts on Mediterranean oak woodland ecosystems. The timely information provided here could lead to better silvicultural practices, preventive measures against the spread of the oomycete and the implementation of early warning tools, to deliver accurate assessments of the defoliation and mortality risk on a meaningful spatio-temporal scale.},

              et al.
              used high-resolution Google Earth imagery to map and classify global forest loss since 2001. Just over a quarter of global forest loss is due to deforestation through permanent land use change for the production of commodities, including beef, soy, palm oil, and wood fiber. Despite regional differences and efforts by governments, conservationists, and corporations to stem the losses, the overall rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined since 2001.

            A high-resolution global map enables a classification of the main drivers of forest loss.
          , 
            Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27\% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26\%), shifting agriculture (24\%), and wildfire (23\%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.},

However, environmental policies most often consist of a package of policy instruments. Further, these studies pay no or very little attention to policy instruments directed at the demand side of the market. Therefore this article develops a policy typology for government intervention aimed at creating green markets. The typology distinguishes between four types of policy based on the balance between the supply-side and demand-side policy instruments. On the basis of the typology, a hypothesis on their ability to expand green markets is generated and tested in a comparative analysis of the performance of organic food policies in Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the US, focusing on their impact on organic consumption. Our analysis demonstrates that cross-country variation in organic food consumption is explained by differences in the packages of policy instruments applied, controlling for numerous systemic and individual-level alternative explanations. The analysis suggests that for environmental and political reasons, governments should apply more demand-side instruments when introducing environmental policies.},

	abstract = {Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More speciﬁcally, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking. Little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of VRG beneﬁts on animal performance or to overcome VRG limitations.},

A significantly negative effect is found between AES expenditures focusing on grassland management and nitrogen concentrations, while AES focusing on crop management, organic farming and preservation of cultural landscape did not show a significant effect. The assessment of other factors such as cereals and forage showed a statistically positive effect on nitrate concen­ trations.

The subsequent analysis reveals that the deployment of funds and policies to support alternative grass-based products remains low in most regions of Europe. Our ﬁndings highlight that aligned funding mechanisms that incorporate and promote the speciﬁc beneﬁts generated by grass-producing and grass-processing businesses are key to overcoming the barriers related to the competition of bio-based products with the established fossil-fuels-based economic system. To make alternative grass-based markets more dynamic, increasing consumer awareness through adequate marketing is perceived as an important aspect.

	abstract = {Maintaining and enhancing the biodiversity of the agriculturally utilised area has a high priority in environmental policy worldwide. Temperate grasslands in Europe make an important contribution to the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. The species and community diversity of grasslands is a result of a traditional extensive grassland management interacting with a broad range of site conditions. Until the early decades of the last century, grassland sites were hardly ameliorated and the agronomic potential was generally low, depending on the fertility of the soils. Later on the production from grassland was markedly improved by regular fertilisation, by liming and by artificial drainage of wet sites. Correspondingly, the stocking rates and the cutting frequency increased. Thus, biodiversity strongly decreased, and unimproved species-rich swards only persisted on a low percentage of the total grassland area. The preservation of the remaining species-rich grassland is a primary goal of nature conservation. The continuation of traditional ways of grassland management that would best preserve biodiversity is often not compatible with the requirements of intensive livestock production. Therefore, this grassland is at risk of being abandoned from agricultural use. There is a need to identify and develop improved management measures that better integrate biodiversity and agronomy targets of species-rich grassland farming. In addition, compensation payments for farmers are required to support grass production on species-rich swards. Apart from the unimproved species-rich grassland, there is an increasing area of now de-intensified species-poor grassland which can be managed to increase biodiversity. Grazing at a low stocking rate seems to have the potential to facilitate the restoration of diverse swards and to support reasonable individual performances of the grazing animals.},

Regulation of the former is comparatively straightforward, with command and control and market instruments the tools of pollution control. The advantages and disadvantages of each measure are outlined. However, the inability to monitor emissions at source, precludes the application of point source measures in the case of diffuse source pollution. Instead, methods are required which overcome the need for direct monitoring. Several suggestions that propose ways of achieving this have been put forward and these are described. It is concluded that appropriate measures depend on the particular features of the problem and it is not possible to offer a blanket solution to either point sources or diffuse pollution. ᮊ 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To guide and structure the review, an analytical framework is developed and applied. The framework integrates transaction costs into the analysis of pollution problems and policies to overcome them. Moreover, it understands a pollution externality not only as a market failure but more generally as the failure of private governance structures. Based on this insight, two rationales for using a policy mix are identified. First, a policy mix may help to correct for multiple reinforcing failures of private governance structures, such as pollution externalities and technological spillovers. Second, a policy mix can be employed if the implementation of single first-best policies brings about high transaction costs, e.g. when marginal pollution damages are heterogeneous or polluters are unlikely to comply with the policy. For each rationale, the relevant literature is presented. Based on the review, avenues for future research are identified.},

For Europe, the European Commission is reforming the CFP legislative framework and has updated and amended the rules for technical measures (EU Regulation 2019/1241).

Using a cost minimization framework, it is shown how complementary relationships lead to costless voluntary provision of non-marketed ES (typically the case for ES that are supportive of provisioning ES for marketed farm products). It is also shown how competitive production relationships lead to provision of nonmarketed ES at lower cost than when non-marketed ES are direct substitutes for farm products or are produced outside of agriculture. The paper closes by showing how the minimum willingness to accept (WTA) payment for ES that are complementary/competitive is less than or equal to the minimum WTA for the same ES produced in substitute or independent production relationships.},

Although there are many studies on the structural determinants of sustainable agriculture related to the pro­ duction systems, markets, and governance, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the valuation of ecosystem services (ES) provided by agricultural landscapes for which no market exists. In this context, the present paper provides estimates of the value of ES related to changes in land use and management in intensive agricultural landscapes in Brazil, using a discrete choice experiment. The results show a significant demand for changes in land use and management to deliver improved ES provision, with marginal willingness to pay (WTP) estimates falling within the R\$104-541 interval (€18-93) per household and year. According to WTP, ES are ordered as follows: improved biodiversity, soil conservation, carbon storage, and aesthetics. Preference heterogeneity points to novel effects worth of closer look in future research.

	abstract = {Information asymmetry is one of the main obstacles to the eﬀective design and implementation of agri-environmental schemes (AES). The literature has generally addressed this issue through the use of principal-agent models (PAM). We develop a PAM to support optimal design of a new AES for improving farmland biodiversity. We use the results of choice experiments to assess both the costs incurred by the agent for the provision of biodiversity and the resulting social beneﬁts. We also make a number of novel contributions such as the inclusion of a non-linear non-compliance detection curve, a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameter estimates have a critical impact on PAM results, and analysis of the eﬃciency of diﬀerent sanction scenarios. The results suggest that: (i) the second-best solutions diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the optimal solutions attainable with perfect information, with farmers being strongly over-compensated for the extra costs associated with improved biodiversity; (ii) monitoring levels should be higher; (iii) the sanction system should be tougher. Sensitivity analysis shows the need for accurate estimates of the marginal cost of public funds and the costs and beneﬁts associated with the public goods, which represent the key parameters determining PAM results.},

	abstract = {Studies of environmental policy performance tend to concentrate on the impact of particular policy institutions or of single policy instruments. However, environmental policies most often consist of a package of policy instruments. Further, these studies pay no or very little attention to policy instruments directed at the demand side of the market. Therefore this article develops a policy typology for government intervention aimed at creating green markets. The typology distinguishes between four types of policy based on the balance between the supply-side and demand-side policy instruments. On the basis of the typology, a hypothesis on their ability to expand green markets is generated and tested in a comparative analysis of the performance of organic food policies in Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the US, focusing on their impact on organic consumption. Our analysis demonstrates that cross-country variation in organic food consumption is explained by differences in the packages of policy instruments applied, controlling for numerous systemic and individual-level alternative explanations. The analysis suggests that for environmental and political reasons, governments should apply more demand-side instruments when introducing environmental policies.},

	abstract = {The wicked sustainability problems that we are increasingly facing not only require new ways of knowledge production, but also challenge our traditional educational system. More and more importance is attached to educational practices and experiments focusing on transdisciplinary problem framing, a pluralistic search for solutions and active collaboration with various stakeholders throughout society. The aim of this article is to investigate how an inter- and transdisciplinary setting in which students develop master theses can contribute to learning about a specific urban problem and what challenges this transdisciplinary education entails. Starting from relevant theoretical and analytical frameworks, such as Mode 2 Science (Nowotny et al. 2005) and the three-phase model of Lang et al. (2012), we first outline the philosophy and approach of the general setting: the Stadsacademie, a collective learning platform or ‘collaboratory’ to explore and investigate wicked problems perceived in the city of Ghent (Belgium). To provide more in-depth and refined insights, we focus on an exemplary activity of the Stadsacademie: the Master Thesis Ateliers ‘Diversity in Social Housing’. A Master Thesis Atelier (MTA) is a collaborative trajectory of one academic year in which 4 to 8 master students and their supervisors from different disciplinary backgrounds concentrate on one specific urban problem and collaborate with non-academic actors aiming to explore and to impact upon that issue. We conclude this article with overall reflections and suggestions for transdisciplinary approaches within educational practices to tackle wicked sustainability issues.},

Nevertheless, the identified resources, services and target groups indicate that the three dimensions of Fraser are at the heart of many of the measures described. We argue that implicit, fragmentary and unspecified adoption of social justice in European UFSs is problematic, as it may hold back public consciousness, debate and collective action regarding food system inequalities and may be easily disregarded in policy budgeting, implementation and evaluation trajectories.

Synergy is interaction among two or more actions, which will lead to an impact greater or less than the sum of individual effects. Therefore, synergy can be positive or negative (trade-off). This paper aims at developing an analytical framework to evaluate sectoral linkages and examine potential synergies and trade-offs among various SDGs’ goals and targets. Synergies and trade-offs related to energy access (SDG7), clean water and sanitation access (SDG6), food security and sustainable agriculture (SDG2) and poverty alleviation (SDG1) have been evaluated from the perspective of developing countries using examples from South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) and Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Ethiopia and Rwanda), and historical data for the period between 1990 and 2012. The analytical framework includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. Network analysis technique has been used for exploring the conceptual linkage among different indicators, and capturing the targets associated with SDGs. Advanced Sustainability Analysis (ASA) developed under the European framework programme has been used for quantifying the synergies and trade-offs among sustainability indicators. The analysis showed strong synergy among various SDG targets. Interestingly, the potential synergy differs from country to country and over time. Ghana and Sri Lanka had relatively higher potential synergy, whereas Rwanda and Nepal had relatively lower potential synergy among the various targets. Higher synergy values were evidenced in those cases where the policy have recognized and emphasized on linkages among cross-sectoral targets.},

@article{rnd_food_nodate,
	title = {Food and nutrition security and poverty alleviation in the {Philippines}},
	abstract = {Poverty, food and nutrition insecurity remain as critical problems in the Philippines. The average Filipino in 1997 needed an annual income of at least P7710 to meet food requirements or P11 319 to meet both food and non-food requirements. Approximately 4 511 000 families (31.8\%) are poor and most of these are in the rural areas. Economic growth in the country has been characterized as a ‘boom and bust’ cycle with growth derailed by a combination of natural calamities, adverse domestic political factors, energy shortages, and external shocks such as the Asian currency crisis. In 1988 the gross national product (GNP) reached a peak of 7.2\% and then declined to less than 1\% in 1991. The economy started to recover in 1992, and the GNP peaked at 7.2\% in 1996. The Asian financial crisis, compounded by the drought in 1998, led to a fall in the output of the agricultural sector by 6.6\%. A stronger world economy, however, in 1999 helped the Philippine economy to recover. The Food Balance Sheet 1997 indicates that there has been a steady increase in the aggregate net food supply in 1992–1997 with the cereals group contributing approximately 25\% of the total food supply. Translating this into calorie supply, this has provided approximately 2400 kcal/person per day or approximately 25\% more than 2000 kcal/day. The fact that mean per capita intake is low indicates a gap between supply, distribution and consumption. The 1998 Food and Nutrition Research Institute survey showed that nutritional deficiencies still persist. Among 0–5-year-old children, underweight was approximately 32.0\%; stunting 34.0\% and wasting 6.0\%. Underweight among 6–10-year-olds was 30.2\% while stunting was 40.8\%. Vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia and iodine deficiency disorder continue as public health concerns. Food security and poverty alleviation are among the top priority programmes. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (1999–2004) enunciates the country’s vision of creating a modern and humane society through improved quality of life characterized by food-secure and poverty-free Filipinos, in an ecologically healthy state. The different government programmes are the following: the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 provides the blueprint for developing and modernizing the agriculture and fisheries sectors; the National Anti-Poverty Alleviation Commission was created as the coordinating and advisory body for the implementation of poverty eradication programmes of the different sectors; the vision of the Medium-Term Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition is of a nutritionally improved country whose people are well nourished, healthy, intelligent, and socially and economically productive with a strong sense of human dignity.},

The essence of decentralization is that it does not occur in general but rather in a particular context, so that decentralization takes many different forms in different countries at different times. Comparative analysis is often illuminating and the article uses it to cast some light on the current moves towards decentralization in the Philippines. Section 2 provides a quantitative overview of the relationship between decentralization and poverty across a number of Asian and Latin American countries. Section 3 discusses key aspects of the relationship between decentralization and poverty alleviation in the Philippines, drawing on a number of decentralization experiences in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Section 3.1 focuses on local capacity and Section 3.2 on local financial resources, in particular the role of fiscal transfers. Section 3.3 examines the effects of different approaches to decentralization on the targeting and delivery of poverty-related services—health, primary education, housing and infrastructure. Section 4 concludes by noting the importance of migration in any treatment of decentralization and poverty. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Under the background of promoting rural revitalization in China, the construction of unified houses has become an important trend of rural development. However, controversy has never ceased over its results. This research set the external form of unified houses as its research object and surveyed forty-two rural unified housing programs distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces. Five physical features (namely, building stories, roof type, courtyard area, window-wall ratio, and residential landscape area) were taken as the research dimensions to evaluate the influence of these features on respondents’ visual impact assessment by means of photo stimulation. Through analyzing the data obtained from experiments, the difference of rural families with different demographic characteristics in their visual impact assessment has been explored. The results show that all the five physical features would influence rural residents’ visual impact assessment of the external form of unified house; families with different demographic characteristics also differ in their visual impact assessment. This research provides constructive reference for the better development of unified housing program in rural China.},

The state has practiced a strategic essentialism with regard to ‘peasantry.’ It has actively taken ‘peasantry’ as a temporary unifying master-category while at the same time working with the diﬀerences within the category for the long-term goal of transformation. The post-Mao contradiction, emphasizing the protection of the ‘peasantry’ while encouraging diﬀerentiation, oﬀers contemporary struggles both opportunity and frustration.

Based on the 2015 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) data and by using a quantitative decomposition method for studying diﬀerences between two groups (Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition method), it is seen that characteristic diﬀerence, coeﬃcient diﬀerence and interaction item account for 40.24, 75.22 and −15.46\% for the total gender variation in education in rural China respectively. Further analysis, based on the diﬀerence decomposition, shows that income, marital status, health status and parents’ educational attainments, are important factors that lead to gender diﬀerences in rural education, while these and the income of parents have higher marginal eﬀects on education of rural women than of rural men. Quantile decomposition reveals the heterogeneity both in factors and their eﬀects and of characteristic-coeﬃcient diﬀerence contributions for diﬀerent quantiles. The discrimination in education of rural females is more obvious at the lower stages of education. Therefore, income growth, improved supply of post-compulsory education for rural women, the construction of appropriate social support systems, and the formation of an intergenerational transmission eﬀect of education within the household should eﬀectively promote their education.},

	abstract = {Over the forty years since reform and opening up, China’s rural land system has undergone a drastic transition from the Two Rights Separation to the Three Rights Separation. Any examination of the latter must be grounded in the crucial field of land transfer. Our fieldwork in different areas across China revealed that the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has driven a drastic increase in the intensive, large-scale transfer of land. As a result, the traditional small-farmer economy is disintegrating, accompanied by a widening distance between farmers and the land. In practice, the Three Rights Separation system exhibits some new characteristics: the growing substantiation of the ownership rights of the village collective, the demutualization of the contracting rights of farm households and the marketization of management rights. At the same time, in practice we have also seen a strengthening of the position of those enjoying ownership rights and management rights and a weakening of the position of those possessing contracting rights. To change the rural land system and accomplish its goal of rural revitalization, China must endeavor to construct a new type of collective market economy.},

	abstract = {The goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and working towards a more equal distribution of incomes are part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Using data from 166 countries comprising 97.5\% of the world’s population, we simulate scenarios for global poverty from 2019 to 2030 under various assumptions about growth and inequality. We use different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality, and rely on a machine-learning algorithm called model-based recursive partitioning to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to World Bank forecasts and historically observed growth rates, our simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living on less than \$1.90/day) will remain above 600 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 7.4\%. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1\% per year, the global poverty rate could reduce to around 6.3\% in 2030, equivalent to 89 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country’s Gini index by 1\% per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country’s annual growth 1 percentage point above forecasts. We also study the impact of COVID-19 on poverty and find that the pandemic may have driven around 60 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. If the pandemic increased the Gini index by 2\% in all countries, then more than 90 million may have been driven into extreme poverty in 2020.},

In this article a spatial econometric model is applied to evaluate the impact of AES on groundwater nitrate concentrations. Bavaria, a federal state of Germany, is used as a case study, due to the findings of high nitrate concentrations in the groundwater. A significantly negative effect is found between AES expenditures focusing on grassland management and nitrogen concentrations, while AES focusing on crop management, organic farming and preservation of cultural landscape did not show a significant effect. The assessment of other factors such as cereals and forage showed a statistically positive effect on nitrate concentrations. However, loam soil texture, rainfall, and residential area were found to negatively affect nitrate concentrations.},

Our findings highlight that aligned funding mechanisms that incorporate and promote the specific benefits generated by grass-producing and grass-processing businesses are key to overcoming the barriers related to the competition of bio-based products with the established fossil-fuels-based economic system. To make alternative grass-based markets more dynamic, increasing consumer awareness through adequate marketing is perceived as an important aspect. Capacity building and alignment efforts need to be strengthened and coordinated at local and higher levels to enable the replication and scale-up of novel grass-based businesses in Europe and beyond.},

The analysis of the CAP shows that permanent grassland is one of the most important types of land to be funded by the EU. Moreover, grazing activities is seen as key to maintain and enhance biodiversity and protect water. There are a lot of cases were undergrazing is a problem, meaning that an excess of pastures is present, that should be adequately maintained through grazing or mowing. Mowing could be carried out if the mowed herbaceous vegetation is utilised for bioeconomy activities. However, only Measure 16 relates the promotion of valued products from grassland, but in a very few RDPs this measure is established as such. Moreover, there is a lack of measures directly targeting knowledge transfer and adequate policies that promote permanent grasslands and bioeconomy at field level.},

	abstract = {Aim National and international policy frameworks, such as the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive, increasingly seek to conserve and reference ‘highly biodiverse grasslands’. However, to date there is no systematic global characterization and distribution map for grassland types. To address this gap, we first propose a systematic definition of grassland. We then integrate International Vegetation Classification (IVC) grassland types with the map of Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW). Location Global. Methods We developed a broad definition of grassland as a distinct biotic and ecological unit, noting its similarity to savanna and distinguishing it from woodland and wetland. A grassland is defined as a non-wetland type with at least 10\% vegetation cover, dominated or co-dominated by graminoid and forb growth forms, and where the trees form a single-layer canopy with either less than 10\% cover and 5 m height (temperate) or less than 40\% cover and 8 m height (tropical). We used the IVC division level to classify grasslands into major regional types. We developed an ecologically meaningful spatial catalogue of IVC grassland types by listing IVC grassland formations and divisions where grassland currently occupies, or historically occupied, at least 10\% of an ecoregion in the TEOW framework. Results We created a global biogeographical characterization of the Earth's grassland types, describing approximately 75\% of IVC grassland divisions with ecoregions. We mapped 49 IVC grassland divisions. Sixteen additional IVC grassland divisions are absent from the map because of the fine-scale distribution of these grassland types. Main conclusions The framework provided by our geographical mapping effort provides a systematic overview of grasslands and sets the stage for more detailed classification and mapping at finer scales. Each regional grassland type can be characterized in terms of its range of biodiversity, thereby assisting in future policy initiatives.},

	abstract = {Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands occur above the timberline on base-rich soils in the high 
mountains of Europe. Harsh climatic conditions (i.e., low temperatures, prolonged frost, heavy snow 
accumulation), which limit the vegetative period to a few months, characterize this habitat. It includes 
many plant communities, mainly in the Elyno-Seslerietea and Ononidetalia striatae phytosociological 
classes. Alpine calcareous grasslands are highly diverse, with abundant endemic and rare species, and 
support alpine birds (e.g., Charadrius morinellus, Lagopus muta) and Lepidoptera (e.g., Erebia, Glacies, 
Colias, Elophos) that have high conservation value. Many of those grassland communities are stable, but very sensitive to disturbances. When the vegetative 
cover is altered or there is significant loss of soil, it is almost impossible to restore the original habitat. 
Active management is not required for the conservation of habitat 6170. Given the high structural 
complexity and fragility of the habitat, the best management practice is to leave it alone. 
The main threats to these grassland communities are inappropriate grazing practices, the construction of 
infrastructures (mainly ski resorts), and perturbations caused by changes in land use and global warming. 
Subalpine and alpine pastures tolerate moderate grazing, and the elimination of grazing can lead to the 
disappearance of some species; however, overgrazing and overstocking in certain areas, e.g., resting 
places, profoundly alter the vegetation and cause soil erosion. SICs and SACs that contain habitat 6170 
should develop plans for grazing management, particularly including the adjustment of stocking 
densities (e.g., grazing intensity {\textless}25\% of net primary production) and regulating grazing practices so that 
conservation objectives are met; e.g. preventing grazing in high alpine communities until vulnerable 
species have completed their reproduction. 
New ski resorts are one of the main threats to alpine calcareous grasslands. The construction and 
maintenance of ski trails lead to the deterioration of alpine habitat; therefore, they should not be built in 
areas where the alpine vegetation has high conservation value. 
There is strong evidence that global warming is leading to changes in alpine vegetation communities 
(e.g., the intrusion of alpine species into higher elevations). Currently, beyond the general measures 
recommended for minimizing the effects of climate change, little more can be done apart from 
establishing a network of monitoring sites at the most representative points in the alpine mountains.},

Despite widespread disagreement about the environmental and production beneﬁts of HM, researchers from both sides of that debate seem to agree that its emphasis on goal-setting, complexity, adaptivity and strategic decision-making are valuable. These ideas are shared by systems thinking, which has long been foundational in agroecology and recognized as a valuable tool for dealing with agricultural complexity. The transmission of such skills is thus important to understand. Here, twenty-ﬁve Canadian and American adaptive grazing trainers were interviewed to learn more about how they teach such systems thinking, and how they reﬂect upon their trainees as learners and potential adopters. Every trainer considered decision-making to be a major component of their lessons. That training was described as tackling both the “paradigm” level—changing the way participants see the world, themselves or their farm—and the “concept/skill” level. Paradigm shifts were perceived as the biggest challenge for participants. Trainers had difﬁculty estimating adoption rates because there was little consensus on what constituted an HM-practitioner: to what level must one adopt the practices? We conclude that: (1) trainers’ emphasis on paradigms and decision-making conﬁrms that HM is systems thinking in practice; (2) the planning and decision-making components of HM are distinct from the grazing methods; and (3) HM is a ﬂuid and heterogeneous concept that is difﬁcult to deﬁne and evaluate.},

	abstract = {Maintaining and enhancing the biodiversity of the agriculturally utilised area has a high priority in environmental policy worldwide. Temperate grasslands in Europe make an important contribution to the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. The species and community diversity of grasslands is a result of a traditional extensive grassland management interacting with a broad range of site conditions. Until the early decades of the last century, grassland sites were hardly ameliorated and the agronomic potential was generally low, depending on the fertility of the soils. Later on the production from grassland was markedly improved by regular fertilisation, by liming and by artificial drainage of wet sites. Correspondingly, the stocking rates and the cutting frequency increased. Thus, biodiversity strongly decreased, and unimproved species-rich swards only persisted on a low percentage of the total grassland area. The preservation of the remaining species-rich grassland is a primary goal of nature conservation. The continuation of traditional ways of grassland management that would best preserve biodiversity is often not compatible with the requirements of intensive livestock production. Therefore, this grassland is at risk of being abandoned from agricultural use. There is a need to identify and develop improved management measures that better integrate biodiversity and agronomy targets of species-rich grassland farming. In addition, compensation payments for farmers are required to support grass production on species-rich swards. Apart from the unimproved species-rich grassland, there is an increasing area of now de-intensified species-poor grassland which can be managed to increase biodiversity. Grazing at a low stocking rate seems to have the potential to facilitate the restoration of diverse swards and to support reasonable individual performances of the grazing animals.},

              The potential to improve soils to help farmers and ranchers adapt to and mitigate climate change has generated significant enthusiasm. Within this discussion, grasslands have surfaced as being particularly important, due to their geographic range, their capacity to store substantial quantities of carbon relative to cultivated croplands and their potential role in mitigating droughts and floods. However, leveraging grasslands for climate change mitigation and adaptation will require a better understanding of how farmers and ranchers who rely on them for their livelihoods can improve management and related outcomes. To investigate opportunities for such improvements, we conducted a meta-analysis of field experiments that investigated how soil water infiltration rates are affected by a range of management options: adding complexity to grazing patterns, reducing stocking rates or extended rest from grazing. Further, to explore the relationships between observed changes in soil water infiltration and soil carbon, we identified papers that reported data on both metrics. We found that in 81.9\% of all cases, responses of infiltration rates to identified management treatments (response ratios) were above zero, with infiltration rates increasing by 59.3 ± 7.3\%. Mean response ratios from unique management categories were not significantly different, although the effect of extended rest (67.9 ± 8.5\%,
              n
              = 140 from 31 experiments) was slightly higher than from reducing stocking rates (42.0 ± 10.8\%;
              n
              = 63 from 17 experiments) or adding complexity (34.0 ± 14.1\%,
              n
              = 17 from 11 experiments). We did not find a significant effect of several other variables, including treatment duration, mean annual precipitation or soil texture; however, analysis of aridity indices suggested that grazing management may have a slightly larger effect in more humid environments. Within our database, we found that 42\% of complexity studies, 41\% of stocking rate studies and 29\% of extended rest studies also reported at least some measure of soil carbon. Within the subset of cases where both infiltration rates and carbon were reported, response ratios were largely positive for both variables (at least 64\% of cases had positive mean response ratios in all management categories). Overall, our findings reveal that a variety of management strategies have the potential to improve soil water infiltration rates, with possible benefits for soil carbon as well. However, we identified a shortage of well-replicated and detailed experiments in all grazing management categories, and call for additional research of both soil water and soil carbon properties for these critical agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although natural terrestrial ecosystems have sequestered ∼25\% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the long-term sustainability of this key ecosystem service is under question. Forests have traditionally been viewed as robust carbon (C) sinks; however, extreme heat-waves, drought and wildﬁre have increased tree mortality, particularly in widespread semi-arid regions, which account for ∼41\% of Earth’s land surface. Using a set of modeling experiments, we show that California grasslands are a more resilient C sink than forests in response to 21st century changes in climate, with implications for designing climate-smart Cap and Trade offset policies. The resilience of grasslands to rising temperatures, drought and ﬁre, coupled with the preferential banking of C to belowground sinks, helps to preserve sequestered terrestrial C and prevent it from re-entering the atmosphere. In contrast, California forests appear unable to cope with unmitigated global changes in the climate, switching from substantial C sinks to C sources by at least the mid-21st century. These results highlight the inherent risk of relying on forest C offsets in the absence of management interventions to avoid substantial ﬁre-driven C emissions. On the other hand, since grassland environments, including tree-sparse rangelands, appear more capable of maintaining C sinks in 21st century, such ecosystems should be considered as an alternative C offset to climate-vulnerable forests. The further development of climate-smart approaches in California’s carbon marketplace could serve as an example to offset programs around the world, particularly those expanding into widespread arid and semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More speciﬁcally, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking. Little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of VRG beneﬁts on animal performance or to overcome VRG limitations.},

	abstract = {The goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and working towards a more equal distribution of incomes are part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Using data from 166 countries comprising 97.5\% of the world’s population, we simulate scenarios for global poverty from 2019 to 2030 under various assumptions about growth and inequality. We use different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality, and rely on a machine-learning algorithm called model-based recursive partitioning to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to World Bank forecasts and historically observed growth rates, our simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living on less than \$1.90/day) will remain above 600 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 7.4\%. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1\% per year, the global poverty rate could reduce to around 6.3\% in 2030, equivalent to 89 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country’s Gini index by 1\% per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country’s annual growth 1 percentage point above forecasts. We also study the impact of COVID-19 on poverty and find that the pandemic may have driven around 60 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. If the pandemic increased the Gini index by 2\% in all countries, then more than 90 million may have been driven into extreme poverty in 2020.},

We compared species density of vascular plants, birds, bees, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders on 202 paired ﬁelds, one with an agri-environment scheme, the other conventionally managed. In all countries, agri-environment schemes had marginal to moderately positive effects on biodiversity. However, uncommon species beneﬁted in only two of ﬁve countries and species listed in Red Data Books rarely beneﬁted from agri-environment schemes. Scheme objectives may need to differentiate between biodiversity of common species that can be enhanced with relatively simple modiﬁcations in farming practices and diversity or abundance of endangered species which require more elaborate conservation measures.},

	abstract = {Over half of the European landscape is under agricultural management and has been for millennia. Many species and ecosystems of conservation concern in Europe depend on agricultural management and are showing ongoing declines. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are designed partly to address this. They are a major source of nature conservation funding within the European Union (EU) and the highest conservation expenditure in Europe. We reviewed the structure of current AES across Europe. Since a 2003 review questioned the overall effectiveness of AES for biodiversity, there has been a plethora of case studies and meta-analyses examining their effectiveness. Most syntheses demonstrate general increases in farmland biodiversity in response to AES, with the size of the effect depending on the structure and management of the surrounding landscape. This is important in the light of successive EU enlargement and ongoing reforms of AES. We examined the change in effect size over time by merging the data sets of 3 recent meta-analyses and found that schemes implemented after revision of the EU’s agri-environmental programs in 2007 were not more effective than schemes implemented before revision. Furthermore, schemes aimed at areas out of production (such as field margins and hedgerows) are more effective at enhancing species richness than those aimed at productive areas (such as arable crops or grasslands). Outstanding research questions include whether AES enhance ecosystem services, whether they are more effective in agriculturally marginal areas than in intensively farmed areas, whether they are more or less cost-effective for farmland biodiversity than protected areas, and how much their effectiveness is influenced by farmer training and advice? The general lesson from the European experience is that AES can be effective for conserving wildlife on farmland, but they are expensive and need to be carefully designed and targeted.},

We apply explanatory typology methods to identify the institutional features that best explain variation in implementation success across a number of cases. We argue that institutional rules shape outcomes in conjunction rather than in isolation. The findings show that differences in implementation success across cases can be explained by the interplay of differences in knowledge exchange, flexibility in implementation, and participation in the policy design process.},

In order to fill in the research gap, this study employs a nationally representative survey of rural households in 2016, to measure subjective poverty in rural China, and analyze the determinants as well. Our results indicate that the mean subjective poverty line of the rural households is 8297 yuan per capita, which is far higher than the national poverty line (2800 yuan). Statistically, 29\% of the surveyed rural households who are not objectively poor feel subjectively poor. The objective poverty line cannot fully reflect the subjective poverty perception. Thus, how to reduce the subjective poverty perception could be a major policy agenda in rural China after 2020, when extreme poverty is no longer a problem.},

	abstract = {As the core component of agricultural development projects, high-standard farmland construction is a reliable measure of agricultural production, and can be used to improve the economy in rural areas. Based on provincial panel data, this paper adopts the continuous difference-indifferences (DID) method to analyze the impact of China’s high-standard basic farmland construction policy on the incidence of rural poverty and its mechanisms. The results show that this policy can signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of rural poverty by 7.4\%, and if, after using robust standard error and bootstrap sampling 1000 times for a robustness test, the regression results are still robust, this also shows that this inhibitory effect is stable and persistent. It can be seen from a heterogeneity analysis that the implementation of the policy has a more signiﬁcant effect on poverty reduction in areas with a higher incidence of rural poverty and a larger scale of land remediation, as well as areas in the eastern and western regions. A mechanism analysis shows that natural disasters, output value and technological progress play a partial intermediary role in the poverty reduction effects of high-standard basic farmland construction policy, and the intermediary effects are 5.79\%, 44.03\%, and 14.13\%, respectively. This paper suggests that we should continue to promote the construction of high-standard basic farmland, explore suitable construction modes of high-standard basic farmland for different regions, continuously promote the process of agricultural modernization, and broaden the ways through which rural residents are able to accumulate capital to promote rural poverty reduction and revitalization.},

	abstract = {Given the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely study on the impacts of and policy response to the pandemic on rural poverty in China is critically important because China has aimed to completely eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020. This paper uses data from the latest round of a nationally representative household panel survey to examine the impacts of the pandemic on rural poverty in China. Our data show that 11.9\% of sample households were ever officially registered as poor households between 2013 and 2019, and this poverty incidence fell to 2.7\% by the end of 2019. In the middle February of 2020, 23\% of the households who have graduated from poverty since 2013 perceived that they would fall back into poverty due to the COVID-19. Among those never poor households, 7.1\% perceived that they would possibly fall into poverty due to the pandemic. Results from both descriptive and multivariate analyses consistently show the interruptions that the pandemic caused in off-farm employment is an important channel that led households to perceive of falling back into or falling into poverty. We also find households in the bottom four quintiles when ranked in terms of household income per capita are much more likely to perceive themselves of falling back into or falling into poverty during this pandemic than those in the richest quintile. Meanwhile, our results show that the education and age of household heads, as well as being from Hubei Province matter in explaining household perception about falling back into or falling into poverty in some cases but not all. The paper concludes with a set of policy responses that China has taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on poverty alleviation.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of e-commerce has played a significant role in recent rural economic development in China. E-commerce is also considered as an efficient channel to alleviate poverty in rural China. Voluminous studies have investigated the contribution of e-commerce to agricultural development, yet it is lacking empirical evidence as to the effects of e-commerce on rural poverty alleviation. Since the year of 2014, in order to develop rural e-commerce, Chinese government launched the National Rural E-commerce Comprehensive Demonstration Project. This gradual involvement policy offered a natural experiment for evaluation of e-commerce. Based on village-level survey data from rural China and Heckit method, our study finds that rural e-commerce has a signiﬁcantly positive effect on rural income. Moreover, the effect is inverted U-shaped for the relative-poverty villages. The estimation of the propensity scores matching model confirms that the results are robust. The following policy recommendations are proposed: (1) policy support to rural e-commerce should prioritize the povertystricken villages. By doing so, the marginal income effects of e-commerce will be maximized. (2) Investment in internet infrastructure and establishment of human resources for e-commerce in rural areas will have spillover effects, increasing rural income through the “digital dividend”.},

Considering village as a random effect, this paper proposes a linear quantile mixed model to analyze the effects of household type, village type, and their interactions on household income, suggesting a test of who benefits more or less from anti-­poverty policies. Results indicate that there has been a somewhat unbalanced development between poverty-­stricken households who are scheduled to be out of poverty earlier and poverty-s­ tricken households who are scheduled to be out of poverty later. The imbalance is slightly different across village types. Results also show that anti-­poverty policies have been equally implemented among village types, but there is some unbalanced development of poverty-s­ tricken and non-­poverty-­stricken households at lower income distribution quantiles depending on village type. Previously unidentified, marginally non-­ poor households are found to benefit disproportionately less from policy measures irrespective of village type.},

Achieving this outcome requires identification of the remaining poor population and a strategy that effectively addresses the causes of their poverty. This article explores the ways in which China has converted itself from the poorest country in the world in 1949 to a country in which extreme poverty is on the verge of disappearance. It examines the roles of economic growth and a a targeted combination of traditional development-oriented policy for poverty counties, villages and regions with wider minimum life guarantees and welfare services. The conclusions draw on a 2017 survey of 4,626 rural households and 13,689 individuals in 628 counties to point to some of the characteristics of the contemporary rural population.},
